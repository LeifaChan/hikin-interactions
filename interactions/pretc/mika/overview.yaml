          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good
          faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s
          kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet,
          and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken
          with a grain of salt.*

    description: >-
      Mika is a Polearm support unit that focuses on increasing his team’s
      Attack Speed and Physical DMG while also offering healing. One of the most
      notable things about Mika is even without Constellations, he currently has
      the highest Attack Speed buff in the game; unfortunately, his Physical DMG
      buffs are quite lacking until C6 unless in a multi-target situation. That
      said, he is not resource-demanding to build, as he only requires ER and
      minor amounts of HP% to do his job.
