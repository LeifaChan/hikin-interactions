      **Favonius Lance:**
    description: >-
      His Best-in-Slot weapon as it _can_ provide more Energy for the whole
      team. In multi-target scenarios, his Skill can hit multiple targets by
      piercing them or with the Fragmentation Shards targeting other enemies,
      making it easier to proc the passive. However, Mika cannot reliably
      trigger the passive in single-target scenarios since his Skill only has
      one instance of damage. Performing extra Normal Attacks lengthens his
      field time for minimal reward; thus, players can choose to treat the extra
      Favonius particles as quality of life instead of building around it.

  - title: '**Prototype Starglitter/”The Catch”/Skyward Spine:**'
    description: >-
      Energy Recharge stat sticks. If not in possession of a spare Favonius
      Lance, the three weapons provide more ER% for Mika himself, easing his
      Energy needs. It’s worth noting that “The Catch” **should** be used on any
      other Polearm character who benefits better from its stats _before_
      slotting it into Mika, and that Skyward Spine has a lower ER% stat
      compared to the other two options.

  - title: '**Black Tassel:**'
    description: >-
      With its HP% stat, Black Tassel provides more healing from his Burst. Only
      use this weapon if ER% needs are already met from artifact substats and
      CRIT Rate is too low to proc Favonius Lance reliably.
