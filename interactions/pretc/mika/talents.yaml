      Typically, it is recommended to level HP-scaling characters to 90.
      However, in Mika's case, this only improves his healing — therefore, it is
      not as high of a priority if a player is comfortable playing without the
      added survivability.


      **Starfrost Swirl [E] - 4 Particles, 15s CD:** Has Tap and Hold versions.
      Mika does a ranged attack with his crossbow: the Tap version shoots an
      arrow that pierces through enemies, while the Hold version shoots a
      Fragmentation Arrow, which explodes on the first enemy hit and launches
      Shards targeted towards other enemies.

      Both uses also grant the *Soulwind Effect* for all party members,
      increasing their Attack Speed based on Talent level.


      With his Ascension 1, Soulwind [E] also grants the Detector effect,
      providing on-field characters 10% Physical DMG Bonus per stack, up to a
      maximum of 3. Detector stacks can be obtained via these means:

      **- Tap Version:** Grants one *Detector stack* per enemy pierced (Except
      the first target)

      **- Hold Version:** Grants one Detector stack per enemy hit by the
      Fragmented Shards. Note that the Shards can’t target the same enemy nor
      the one hit by the main arrow attack.

      - It is recommended to use his Hold Skill in multi-target situations since
      landing piercing hits with Tap Skill is much more difficult.

      - With his Ascension 4, if the active character crits and has both the
      *Soulwind [E]* and the *Skyfeather Song [Q]* effects, they gain one
      Detector stack. Only one Detector stack can be gained in this manner per
      *Soulwind [E]* effect. A4 also increases the maximum *Detector* stacks
      from 3 to 4.


      It’s worth noting that at C0, Mika can only grant **one Detector stack**
      from his A4 in total in single-target scenarios. One extra single-target
      Detector stack can be gained upon his arrow hitting with either Tap or
      Hold version via his C2.



      **Skyfeather Song [Q] - 70 Energy, 18s CD:** Mika heals all party members
      and grants on-field characters *Eagleplume* for 15 seconds, which heals
      on-field characters by a small portion when they deal Normal Attacks, with
      a CD of 2.5 seconds for each healing instance.


      - His Elemental Burst neither deals damage nor has Elemental application,
      so it is mainly used for healing and gaining 1 *Detector* stack via his A4
      for Physical characters.

      - When Mika is not used in Physical-focused teams and the healing is not
      needed, *Skyfeather Song [Q]* can be skipped.
