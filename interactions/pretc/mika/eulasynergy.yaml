      **__Eula Specific Information__**

      **Attack Speed Buff:**
    description: >-
      Mika has one of the strongest Attack SPD buffs in the game, which can make
      Eula feel better to play by increasing the fluidity of her attacks.
      However, due to her being a Claymore character, hitlag can diminish the
      actual effects of Attack SPD buffs. This results in her only being able to
      fit in two more Normal Attacks in her combo; unfortunately, only one of
      these Normal Attacks will land in time before her Lightfall Sword locks in
      the stack count. In practice, without Song of Broken Pines, Eula can
      increase her stack count from 13 -> 15 rather comfortably. For Pines
      users, the stack increase is only 14 -> 15 stacks.

  - title: '**Eula Can Not Swap Early**'
    description: >-
      Mika’s buffs only apply to the on-field unit. This can be detrimental for
      players who are swapping out early on Eula to:

      - apply Cryo for Cryo Resonance with Rosaria for 15% CRIT Rate

      - detonate Eula’s Burst slightly early so Rosaria’s A4 CRIT Rate buff does
      not expire

      - detonate Burst manually when weak enemies are grouped up

      - shorten their rotations if they have overkill damage; especially in the
      case of C6 Eula players

      - detonate Burst manually before an enemy goes into an invincibility phase


      This additional layer of restriction can add gameplay grief for Eula
      players on top of existing conditions that she has to contend with.

  - title: '**Particle Generation:**'
    description: >-
      Even though four Cryo particles is a hefty amount of Energy, it has a 15
      second cooldown, which means that you cannot fit two Skills in a typical
      Eula rotation. This means that Mika effectively generates less Energy than
      Eula’s classic supports such as Rosaria, Diona, or Shenhe.


      This problem is also exacerbated by the fact that Mika does not have as
      many hits as Diona or Rosaria to activate Favonius comfortably. His Burst
      does not deal damage, so Mika has to coinflip whether his Skill will proc
      Favonius without the option to weave in Normal Attacks since he must swap
      to Eula in time to funnel particles.

  - title: '**Low Cryo Application**'
    description: >-
      Mika only applies Cryo once with his Skill, which is not ideal if he is
      the only Cryo unit supporting Eula. Having consistent, off-field Cryo
      application is something that is much appreciated.

  - title: '**Larger Damage Numbers**'
    description: >-
      Even at C6, Mika is more of a sidegrade option for Eula teams due to all
      of the factors above impacting either total team DPS or general gameplay
      comfort. That being said, Mika **will** enable your Eula to hit larger
      numbers on her Normal Attacks and Burst due to him enhancing her CRIT
      Damage and Physical DMG% at the cost of team DPS. So for players that
      drool over the idea of hitting that THICC, FAT damage number with their
      Eula Burst, Mika can definitely look appealing even with his downsides.
