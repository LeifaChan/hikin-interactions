    __**TALENT OVERVIEW**__


    **Normal Attacks: Schematic Setup**

    Aside from the funny animations, Kaveh’s Normal and Charged Attacks aren’t particularly impressive. They do gain a Dendro Infusion after using his Burst, though.

    **Elemental Skill: Artistic Ingenuity**

    __**CD : 6s**__


    A Skill cast generates **two Dendro Particles** and **detonates all Dendro Cores** in its radius, triggering Bloom instantly. Note that Kaveh does not claim ownership of the Blooms – whoever generated the Dendro Core still retains ownership.

    __**Energy Cost : 80**__


    The most important part of Kaveh’s kit. Upon cast, all Dendro Cores are ruptured immediately (similar to his Elemental Skill). Kaveh’s Burst grants him two important features: his Normal Attacks gain a **Dendro Infusion**, and the entire team gains a **Bloom Reaction DMG Bonus**. Additionally, he gains Interruption Resistance. Bear in mind that these effects are only active while Kaveh is **on-field**, and will be canceled if you swap out. Though his kit states that these effects have a **duration of 12s**, it’s possible to extend this via hitlag. The high Energy Cost and the fact that most of Kaveh’s utilities are locked behind his Burst does reduce his flexibility.
