    __Passives__

    **Ascension 1 Passive: An Architect’s Undertaking**
  description: >-
    Kaveh regenerates HP based off 300% of his EM every time he is damaged by Bloom, Burgeon, or Hyperbloom. With 800 EM and C1, Kaveh heals himself for 3000 HP. Each 100 points of EM equals 375 HP worth of healing (at C1).  This Passive can be triggered once every 0.5s, which conveniently aligns with Bloom, Burgeon, and Hyperbloom’s self-damage cooldowns, but note that it may be difficult to get hit by your own Hyperblooms due to its small AoE. This Talent is a significant boon to Kaveh’s survivability and makes EM more valuable; unfortunately, it does not heal the rest of the team.
    With a 70 Cost Burst and 18s CD, Dehya’s Energy Recharge requirements are massive at 200% or more with a Favonius weapon on the team and multiple Pyro teammates, and without exceptional payoff.

    **Ascension 4 Passive: A Craftsman’s Curious Conceptions**
  description: >-
    After using Kaveh’s Elemental Burst, each Normal, Charged, or Plunge Attack increases his EM by 25 for up to a maximum of 4 stacks. An easy boost to healing and Bloom damage. This effect is cleared after Kaveh leaves the field.

    **Overworld Passive: The Art of Budgeting**
  description: >-
    Unsurprisingly, our architect’s passive has to do with the Serenitea Pot: Kaveh refunds a portion of your materials when crafting Landscape, Building, and Courtyard-type Furnishings. Yoimiya has a similar passive, but for different Furnishing types. Rejoice, Serenitea Pot players!

- title : Effective EM Buff
  description: |-
    The Bloom Reaction DMG Bonus that Kaveh provides scales with his Elemental Burst’s Talent level. It’s a miniscule increase for his personal damage, but the team DPS you gain makes his Burst your first talent priority. At Talent Level 9, this translates to 8% more Bloom DMG, assuming the trigger has 800 EM. However, this DMG Bonus does not apply to Hyperbloom, Burgeon, or Spread, so if you plan to play such teams, his Burst can be prioritized last. Here is a look at how much effective EM Kaveh’s buff equates to at Talent Level 9:
