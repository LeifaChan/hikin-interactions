    **C5 - Treasures of Bonkhanak**

    *Increases the Level of **Artistic Ingenuity** by 3.*

    Unfortunately, the damage of the Skill itself is quite low, since most of Kaveh’s damage comes from his Normal Attacks and/or Blooms. This means that you won’t be getting much in terms of extra damage.

    **C6 -  Pairidaeza's Dreams**
  description: >- 
    *When Kaveh's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents during **Painted Dome**, it will unleash Pairidaeza's Light upon the opponent's position, dealing 61.8% of Kaveh's ATK as AoE Dendro DMG and causing all Dendro Cores within that AoE to burst. This effect can be triggered once every 3s.*


    C6 is Kaveh’s best constellation for non-Nilou Bloom teams, giving him 3-4 more detonations, C4 procs, *and* Dendro application. Because Kaveh forces multiple Blooms to rupture at once, you may get less value than you’re hoping for from his Skill usage if you have more than two Cores from a single owner. His Elemental Skill is on a 6 second cooldown, meaning that Pairidaeza’s Light can sneak in some extra forced Core explosions while waiting. Furthermore, Kaveh’s C4 buff works on C6 explosions.


    On Bloom teams, C6 provides a modest boost to team damage when used in conjunction with C4, almost doubling the number of C4 procs. This further enhances Kaveh’s viability as a Bloom support. In a team where the Bloom owner has an average of 800 EM, and Kaveh adds his C4 onto 16 of the team’s 40 Blooms, his team gains an increase of about 2.0% from C4. This isn’t as necessary when running Nilou teams, since Bountiful Cores already explode quicker than Kaveh can trigger them, making C6 less valuable. Furthermore, C6 can prematurely rupture your Hyperblooms and Burgeons, possibly resulting in lower team DPS.


    The Pairidaeza’s Light damage itself is nothing to write home about in a standard EM-centric build. Even if you reached 2000 ATK, you’d only get about 1200 damage from it, which is pitiful next to even one extra Bloom.
