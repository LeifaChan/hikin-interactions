    ðŸŒ¿ Try to get in **three Skill casts** to manage Kavehâ€™s Energy. To do this, cast one Skill around the start of your rotation. Cast the other two during Kavehâ€™s Burst.
    
    ðŸŒ¿ **N3 Dash** is his best Normal Attack combo as it has the highest MVs and Dendro application.
    
    ðŸŒ¿ **Avoid** casting Burst > Skill or Skill > Burst in quick succession. If you Burst and rupture your Dendro Cores, you wonâ€™t have anything to detonate if you use your Skill right away!
    
    ðŸŒ¿ Make sure there are Dendro Cores in the radius to make sure your Burst/Skill actually detonates them.
    
    ðŸŒ¿ Avoid spending too much time on Kaveh â€“ your Hydro/Electro/Pyro application and buffs will expire eventually.
