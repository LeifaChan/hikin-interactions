    Kaveh is an on-field Dendro unit with self-healing and Interruption Resistance, allowing him to drive virtually any Dendro-based team. In particular, he will shine in Bloom teams, which is what his kit specializes in. There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing teammates for Kaveh:


    üèõÔ∏è Because of his long field time, his teammates are off-field units.
    

    üèõÔ∏è He only heals himself, not his teammates. For some people this is more than enough, but for others you might still want an extra healer.
    

    üèõÔ∏è He has high ER needs, which incentivizes bringing a second Dendro unit. He can still play as a solo Dendro, but you‚Äôll have to invest in a lot of ER (check ER Requirement for more details).

    __Bloom Team__
  description: |-
    
    **Kaveh | Hydro | Hydro | Dendro or Flex**

    **Example Team:** *Kaveh/Xingqiu/Kokomi/Nahida*

    **Example Team 2:** *Kaveh/Yelan/Ayato/Kazuha*

    Kaveh‚Äôs utilities are geared towards Bloom teams ‚Äî he can drive, heal himself, buff Blooms, and instantly detonate Cores, giving him a special spot in such teams. Due to Bloom‚Äôs mechanics, it‚Äôll often be the Hydro unit(s) triggering them. As such, they usually favour EM builds, but their base Hydro DMG may be high enough that they still appreciate ATK/CRIT stats. Depending on how much Hydro and Dendro application you have, Kaveh still claims ownership of a few Dendro Cores here and there. The 4th slot can be a Dendro unit to supply extra Elemental application, contribute to Dendro Resonance, and battery Kaveh. Alternatively, you can use a Flex unit such as Kazuha or Sucrose to provide grouping and buffs. Bear in mind that without a second Dendro character, Kaveh becomes Energy-deficient and *he* becomes the one triggering Blooms. You can choose to play him as a solo Dendro, but he won‚Äôt be generating many Blooms anyway due to his mild Dendro application (especially before C6). It is recommended to play Bloom compositions in AoE stages.

    **Nilou Bloom Variant**
  description: |-

    **Kaveh | Nilou | Hydro | Dendro**

    Example Team: *Kaveh/Nilou/Xingqiu/Baizhu*

    Example Team 2: *Kaveh/Nilou/Yelan/Xingqiu*


    While reading Kaveh‚Äôs kit, did you ever think: ‚ÄúWait, isn‚Äôt this just Dendro Nilou?‚Äù Well, you‚Äôre not entirely wrong ‚Äî both units buff Blooms and can instantly rupture them, although Kaveh does it worse. Their overlapping utilities make Kaveh redundant; nonetheless, he is still a fine Dendro option to slot into Nilou teams. He is an adequate driver, has strong personal survivability, and can still buff Bountiful Blooms. Building Nilou teams is similar to building a regular Bloom team, except you cannot use any units that aren‚Äôt Dendro or Hydro. As usual, Nilou runs full HP and your other Hydro character runs EM. Due to the abundance of Bountiful Blooms exploding, you‚Äôll also want to run EM on Kaveh to improve his healing. You might even want to use a healer if his healing isn‚Äôt enough for you. Just like regular Bloom teams, Nilou Bloom excels in AoE chambers. 


    __*What about Fridge?*__

    Contrary to what the last week of beta changes said, testing shows that Kaveh‚Äôs Normal Attacks still Shatter, and with it our Fridge dreams are also shattered.

    Burgeon & Hyperbloom


  fields:
  - name: 'Burgeon'
    value: |- 

      **Kaveh | Hydro | Pyro | Flex**
    
      **Example Team:** *Kaveh/Xingqiu/Thoma/Bennett*


      **Example Team 2:** *Kaveh/Xingqiu/Kazuha/Bennett*

  - name: 'Hyperbloom'
    value: |- 
      
      **Kaveh | Hydro | Electro | Flex**


      **Example Team:** *Kaveh/Xingqiu/Raiden/Ayato*


      **Example Team 2:** *Kaveh/Xingqiu/Kuki/Nahida*


      Although Kaveh‚Äôs Burst only buffs Blooms, his self-healing and Interruption Resistance makes him a comfortable driver for both Burgeon and Hyperbloom teams, especially the former where self-damage is an issue. His detonations can steal Burgeons and Hyperbloom procs, but it may be possible to delay your Skill and Burst casts to minimize this problem. Ideally, you‚Äôll be getting both Bloom and Hyperbloom/Burgeon damage. 
      
      On the other hand, his C6 procs cannot be controlled unless you literally don‚Äôt use his Normal Attacks at all. There‚Äôs a chance that C6 is a DPS loss, but in-game testing will have to be done to ascertain this. Even so, the extra Bloom damage may partially compensate for the loss of Hyperblooms/Burgeons.
