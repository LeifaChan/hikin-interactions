    description: >-
      Her Energy Requirement falls around 170%-180%. This is due to the fact
      that her particle generation is not that great and when she wants to get
      ownership on certain reactions, she will mostly be running as a solo
      Electro unit. Generally, Support Kuki needs to burst only if you need to
      extend your rotation time to fit CDs. For Physical, its optional to proc
      Superconduct or get a bit of DMG from it and for Reaction-based comps, you
      need to have the optimal ER as given above.


      In non-EM DPS scenarios, it is better to ignore the use of Shinobuâ€™s burst
      entirely, allowing these stats to instead be allocated to much-needed
      offensive stats like CRIT, DMG%, and ATK%.
