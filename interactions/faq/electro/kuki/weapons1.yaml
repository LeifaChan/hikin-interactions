      Kuki’s Weapon choices are plain and simple for her support capabilities.
      Five-star weapons are by no means necessary for performance, but we will
      still list them for the people who are interested in it. Reason being is
      that those 5* Weapons can be put on another support or DPS such as
      Bennett, Kazuha, or Ayato. As for DPS Kuki, it will also vary into
      Physical Kuki and Reaction-based Kuki.

      *Support Weapons*

      **Favonius Sword**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for a 4* option. Provides enough ER for her ER Requirement and gives particles for the entire party. This weapon's passive is super easy to proc with her Elemental Burst having 7 or 13 hits depending on her current HP. Keep in mind that while using a Favonius weapon, Crit Rate is an important substat to look out for.

      **Freedom Sworn**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for a 5* option. A really outstanding weapon on her. Being able to buff Normal, Charged, Plunging attacks, and ATK% plus with the Tenacity of the Millelith can benefit a Normal, Charged, or Plunging based DPS quite a lot. Due to her ICD being standard, she can proc the passive really fast as well.

      **Primordial Jade Cutter**
    description: >-
      Her standard 5* weapon due to it having a HP% passive that benefits her ATK% as well. This weapon makes her dual scalings really easier to build as her HP gets turned into ATK%. Great option if you have no character that currently holds this weapon.

      **Sacrificial Sword**
    description: >-
      Secondary to Favonius Sword, this weapon allows Kuki Shinobu to reach below 50% HP really fast, triggering her A1 passive that can benefit artifact sets like Ocean-Hued Clam. It also allows her Elemental Burst to hit 13 times for 3.5 second duration due to her being under 50% HP.

      ***Physical DPS Weapons***

      **Aquila Favonia**
    description: >-
      Provides Physical DMG Bonus as well as ATK%. When spamming N1C, this is Kuki’s BiS sword. The healing from the passive can be used with Ocean-Hued Clam’s DMG, which benefits both weapon and artifact debuffing the enemy as both are physically based in DMG.

      **Haran Geppaku Futsu**
    description: >-
      When N4D spamming, as well as when teaming up with Yunjin, Haran becomes Kuki’s BiS sword for damage. It is pretty easy to stack as the supports the Kuki will use primarily will use their Elemental Skill to battery themselves or other party members, which mean its easy to get the Normal ATK DMG% Buff. In deviant builds, or when using Yunjin, Haran beats out Aquila Favonia for BiS in terms of personal damage.

      **Summit Shaper**
    description: >-
      This weapon is generally associated with a shielder, which Kuki does not need as she provides enough comfort through her heals. If you have Zhongli on your party, highly recommend him to be paired with Kuki when using this weapon on her. He also provides Physical and Elemental Shred for the entire party, which Kuki Shinobu can use to further increase her DMG. Without a shielder, however, this weapon falls below 4* options.

      **Prototype Rancour**
    description: >-
      Her F2P Sword to use. Really simple to build around with as well as its passive buffing her ATK% to further up her DMG. Really straightforward weapon for Physical DPS Kuki and will do about as good with refinements as other gacha options.
