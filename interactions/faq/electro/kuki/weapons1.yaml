      Kuki’s Weapon choices are plain and simple for her support capabilities.
      Five-star weapons are by no means necessary for performance, but we will
      still list them for the people who are interested in it. Reason being is
      that those 5* Weapons can be put on another support or DPS such as
      Bennett, Kazuha, or Ayato. As for DPS Kuki, it will also vary into
      Physical Kuki and Reaction-based Kuki.

      *Support Weapons*

      **Favonius Sword**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for a 4* option. Provides enough ER for her ER Requirement and gives particles for the entire party. This weapon's passive is super easy to proc with her Elemental Burst having 7 or 13 hits depending on her current HP. Keep in mind that while using a Favonius weapon, Crit Rate is an important substat to look out for.

      **Freedom Sworn**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for a 5* option. A really outstanding weapon on her. Being able to buff Normal, Charged, Plunging attacks, and ATK% plus with the Tenacity of the Millelith can benefit a Normal, Charged, or Plunging based DPS quite a lot. Due to her ICD being standard, she can proc the passive really fast as well.

      **Primordial Jade Cutter**
    description: >-
      Her standard 5* weapon due to it having a HP% passive that benefits her ATK% as well. This weapon makes her dual scalings really easier to build as her HP gets turned into ATK%. Great option if you have no character that currently holds this weapon.

      **Sacrificial Sword**
    description: >-
      Secondary to Favonius Sword, this weapon allows Kuki Shinobu to reach below 50% HP really fast, triggering her A1 passive that can benefit artifact sets like Ocean-Hued Clam. It also allows her Elemental Burst to hit 13 times for 3.5 second duration due to her being under 50% HP.

      ***Physical DPS Weapons***

      **Aquila Favonia**
    description: >-
      Provides Physical DMG Bonus as well as ATK%. When spamming N1C, this is Kuki’s BiS sword. The healing from the passive can be used with Ocean-Hued Clam’s DMG, which benefits both weapon and artifact debuffing the enemy as both are physically based in DMG.

      **Haran Geppaku Futsu**
    description: >-
      When N4D spamming, as well as when teaming up with Yunjin, Haran becomes Kuki’s BiS sword for damage. It is pretty easy to stack as the supports the Kuki will use primarily will use their Elemental Skill to battery themselves or other party members, which mean its easy to get the Normal ATK DMG% Buff. In deviant builds, or when using Yunjin, Haran beats out Aquila Favonia for BiS in terms of personal damage.

      **Summit Shaper**
    description: >-
      This weapon is generally associated with a shielder, which Kuki does not need as she provides enough comfort through her heals. If you have Zhongli on your party, highly recommend him to be paired with Kuki when using this weapon on her. He also provides Physical and Elemental Shred for the entire party, which Kuki Shinobu can use to further increase her DMG. Without a shielder, however, this weapon falls below 4* options.

      **Prototype Rancour**
    description: >-
      Her F2P Sword to use. Really simple to build around with as well as its passive buffing her ATK% to further up her DMG. Really straightforward weapon for Physical DPS Kuki and will do about as good with refinements as other gacha options.

      **The Black Sword**
    description: >-
      Same as Aquilla Favonia’s Passive, the healing from this weapon counts into Ocean-Hued Clam’s DMG. Not only that, the Normal and Charged ATK% Buff along with it helps her DMG and being a 4* Crit stat stick helps the healing passive more often to proc. The Black Sword is the easiest 4-star weapon to build with, due to it’s CRIT Rate secondary stat, and outperforms all other 4-stars when max-refined.

      *Reaction-Based Weapon*

      **Freedom Sworn**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for reaction damage, due to having the most amount of EM that Kuki could use to deal a ton of Transformative Reactions. It also brings a teamwide ATK% Buff and DMG% bonus for Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks. It is also the 5-star BiS for Support builds.

      **Iron Sting**
    description: >-
      Her 4* F2P option. The EM on this weapon is really good to use and its passive really compliments Kuki’ Shinobu's lack of DMG% with triple EM. With refinements, her DMG really ups a lot.

      **Favonius Sword**
    description: >-
      The Favonius Sword is her best support weapon, yes, but also takes care of all of the Energy Recharge requirements for Shinobu, allowing her to run a full EM build. It is 2% less damage than an R1 Iron Sting, but also serves to battery the party. A solid option.

      **Lion’s Roar**
    description: >-
      A conditional weapon. This weapon can compete DMG if the passive uptime is 100%. The stat that goes along with it is not necessary but can amp up her Elemental Skill DMG. Generally, this underperforms even at high refinements compared to the 3-star Dark Iron Sword

      **Festering Desire**
    description: >-
      Another F2P option that you can use. Provides a good ER amount, passive is really good in terms of Kuki’s source of DMG, and everyone gets R5 for free (unless you played after 1.2). Generally, this weapon focuses more on her Elemental Skill than her Elemental Burst, which in an triple EM Kuki, will lack on the Elemental Burst side of DMG.

      **Dark Iron Sword**
    description: >-
      3* option. The EM on this weapon surpasses The Alley Flash’s EM and provides an ATK% Buff which Kuki can use to further up her DMG. For reactions, the sword’s passive is rarely relevant. It is the bare minimum option when you have no crafting materials to spare and there is no Favonius Sword to speak of.
