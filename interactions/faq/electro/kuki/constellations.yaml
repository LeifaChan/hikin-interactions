    description: >-
      Many of Kuki Shinobu’s Constellations have requirements to take effect. C4
      needs Normal, Charged, and Plunging attacks while off-field, while C6
      requires her to be at low health.With that in mind, her constellation
      focuses more on her Elemental Skill as it is her bread and butter of her
      entire kit.


      **C1** - This constellation increases the AOE of her Elemental Burst,
      Currently, there is no footage of how big the AOE is as of now but
      assuming we hit 2 or more enemies with C1 Elemental Burst, it is a small
      DMG increase.


      DMG Increase from C0: 0%


      **C2** - Extending the duration of her Elemental Skill from 12 seconds to
      15 seconds aligns with the Elemental Skill CD. This boosts her support
      capabilities quite a lot as she can give Tenacity of the Millelith Buff
      100% uptime. 


      DMG Increase from C0: 5%

      DMG Increase from previous cons: 5%


      **C3** - Increases her Elemental Skill Talent LVL by 3. Ups her healing
      and DMG potential. Good stopping point if you are rolling for her.


      DMG Increase from C0: 10%

      DMG Increase from previous cons: 5%


      **C4** - Basically, its like Fischl A4 but has a longer CD and its
      triggering pattern relies on Normal, Charged, Plunging ATK. Really good on
      team comps that relies on this type of attack patterns such as Itto Comps
      or Xiao Comps.


      DMG Increase from C0: 60%

      DMG Increase from previous cons: 45%


      **C5** - Increases her Elemental Burst Talent LVL by 3. Generally is good
      if you are using her burst on a team composition like Overload or
      Electro-Charged comps.


      DMG Increase from C0: 75%

      DMG Increase from previous cons: 8%-8.5%


      **C6** - This constellation is like Hu Tao’s very own C6. When her health
      drops to 25% or she takes a lethal DMG, this constellation will be
      triggered. She will gain 150 EM and she will not fall in battle. Somewhat
      a good constellation on reaction-based composition without a shielder and
      lowering Kuki’s healing potential.


      DMG Increase from C0: 150%-155%

      DMG Increase from previous cons: 45%
