          Dendro is a new element and there are many things we still do not know
          about the new elemental reactions. 

          Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until
          release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical
          suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis
          based on the little information about the character’s kit that we
          know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with
          everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain
          of salt.

  - title: __***Character Overview***__
    description: >-
      Kuki Shinobu is a 4* Electro Support unit that specializes in off-field
      healing and consistent Electro application at close range. She is a
      character that provides sustain, buffing w/ ToTM, and decent Electro
      application. With her Elemental Skill, she can deal DMG and heal allies.
      With her Elemental Burst, she can deal multiple instances of Electro DMG
      in a small area that scales with her HP.


      Shinobu can also carry the Tenacity of the Millelith artifact and Favonius
      Sword, which makes her a buffer and a battery at the same time. Her DMG
      capabilities are low as her scalings are split between HP% and ATK%, along
      with ascension passives that do little to no increase on her kit as her A1
      isn’t achievable on certain team compositions and her A4 being mediocre.
      Her constellations are currently lackluster, and it’s recommended to stop
      at C4 to maximize her DMG. However, since most will be playing her as a
      support unit, these constellations aren’t necessary, except maybe C2 for
      100% uptime on Shinobu’s Skill. Her current team compositions are flexible
      since many teams need or want a healer, especially teams featuring a
      physical DPS that need regular Superconduct reactions.


      **Indications of her kit may developed in the future with the Dendro
      Reaction: Intensify. Will need further theorycrafting about it.**
