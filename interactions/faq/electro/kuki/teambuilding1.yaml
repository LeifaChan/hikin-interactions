      **Yae** - Kuki is the Electro Healer everyone asked for to accompany their
      Electro DPS so she  pairs well with Yae as a healer. Yae still needs
      Raiden to battery her as Kuki does not produce that much particle for Yae
      to keep her Elemental  Burst energy uptime.

      **Raiden Shogun**
    description: >-
      Basically the same as Yae. Kuki benefits them both as they are synergetic with each other. With this in mind, Mono Electro Compositions that tends to run Yae Sara Jean can be replaced by Yae Kuki Kazuha.

      **Itto**
    description: >-
      The One and Oni. Her leader and the Deputy Commander of the Arataki Gang. Kuki can provide healing to Itto’s general team as he currently does not have a dedicated healer outside of C4 Gorou, as Bennett frankly takes space in other compositions.

      **Eula**
    description: >-
      Kuki opens up Raiden to go to another team and be Eula’s overall Electro support. Kuki can also use Ocean-Hued Clam with Eula as they both benefit from the physical shred with Clam Kuki.

      **Tartaglia**
    description: >-
      Kuki replacing Fischl and Bennett and bringing in Kazuha
      seems to work well for Electro-Charged Tartaglia. There is still the
      downside of which one is procing the Electro-Charged since the reaction
      itself is hard to find whose owner its basing its DMG off. Opening up
      Bennett to be put on another team really helps some teams a lot if you own
      Tartaglia and Bennett.

      **Ayato**
    description: >-
      Kuki w/ C4 can utilize TF (Thundering Fury) Ayato but it needs another Electro unit for Ayato to consistently proc Electro-Charged and since Kuki’s A4 has a 5 second cooldown before it procs again, Ayato can proc it 2 times in 1 Elemental Skill.

      **Bennett**
    description: >-
      For DPS Kuki, Bennett will always be the buffer that DPS will need (unless he is C6 which Physical Kuki can not use). He provides an insane amount of ATK Buff as well as healing and can hold 4PC Noblesse Oblige to increase Kuki’s DMG.

      **Xiangling**
    description: >-
      Since Bennett is here, Xiangling will also be here. She provides Kuki with Pyro Aura uptime since her Pyronado has no ICD, which mean Kuki can trigger Overload with her ownership of DMG on it.

      **Kazuha**
    description: >-
      A Anemo unit that can hold VV. It is a straightforward explanation. Kazuha provides Elemental DMG Bonus that Kuki will lack on a triple EM gear or a supportive gear. With VV, he can shred Electro RES for Kuki to amp her DMG up.

      **Sucrose**
    description: >-
      Another Anemo Unit that greatly helps Kuki. Her EM Buff transfer really ups Kuki’s DMG in Reaction-based comps and along with C6, provides her with Elemental DMG if Sucrose Burst manages to absorb Electro.
