    description: >-
      **Yae** - Kuki is the Electro Healer everyone asked for to accompany their
      Electro DPS so she  pairs well with Yae as a healer. Yae still needs
      Raiden to battery her as Kuki does not produce that much particle for Yae
      to keep her Elemental  Burst energy uptime.


      **Raiden Shogun** - Basically the same as Yae. Kuki benefits them both as
      they are synergetic with each other. With this in mind, Mono Electro
      Compositions that tends to run Yae Sara Jean can be replaced by Yae Kuki
      Kazuha.


      **Itto** - The One and Oni. Her leader and the Deputy Commander of the
      Arataki Gang. Kuki can provide healing to Itto’s general team as he
      currently does not have a dedicated healer outside of C4 Gorou, as Bennett
      frankly takes space in other compositions.


      **Eula** - Kuki opens up Raiden to go to another team and be Eula’s
      overall Electro support. Kuki can also use Ocean-Hued Clam with Eula as
      they both benefit from the physical shred with Clam Kuki.


      **Tartaglia** - Kuki replacing Fischl and Bennett and bringing in Kazuha
      seems to work well for Electro-Charged Tartaglia. There is still the
      downside of which one is procing the Electro-Charged since the reaction
      itself is hard to find whose owner its basing its DMG off. Opening up
      Bennett to be put on another team really helps some teams a lot if you own
      Tartaglia and Bennett.


      **Ayato** - Kuki w/ C4 can utilize TF (Thundering Fury) Ayato but it needs
      another Electro unit for Ayato to consistently proc Electro-Charged and
      since Kuki’s A4 has a 5 second cooldown before it procs again, Ayato can
      proc it 2 times in 1 Elemental Skill.



      **Bennett** - For DPS Kuki, Bennett will always be the buffer that DPS
      will need (unless he is C6 which Physical Kuki can not use). He provides
      an insane amount of ATK Buff as well as healing and can hold 4PC Noblesse
      Oblige to increase Kuki’s DMG.


      **Xiangling** - Since Bennett is here, Xiangling will also be here. She
      provides Kuki with Pyro Aura uptime since her Pyronado has no ICD, which
      mean Kuki can trigger Overload with her ownership of DMG on it.


      **Kazuha** - A Anemo unit that can hold VV. It is a straightforward
      explanation. Kazuha provides Elemental DMG Bonus that Kuki will lack on a
      triple EM gear or a supportive gear. With VV, he can shred Electro RES for
      Kuki to amp her DMG up.


      **Sucrose** - Another Anemo Unit that greatly helps Kuki. Her EM Buff
      transfer really ups Kuki’s DMG in Reaction-based comps and along with C6,
      provides her with Elemental DMG if Sucrose Burst manages to absorb
      Electro.


      **Jean** - Anemo mom with Bennett can provide Pyro for Kuki to Overload
      along with Xiangling, or so it is called “Sunfire” setup. Really versatile
      support to bring along with Kuki as she can hold Favonius instead of Kuki
      while bringing a much stronger heals to keep whoever is on the field
      alive.


      **Venti** - The Anemo Archon. Great for grouping up enemies that are
      needed for a Overload Comp. Can suffice for batterying hard Pyro
      applicator such as Xiangling by absorbing Pyro in his Elemental Burst.


      **Rosaria** - Kuki can utilize Rosaria Crit Rate Buff as well as her C6
      Physical Shred on Physical DPS Kuki. She can also provide decent energy
      for the team if being used with Favonius Lance.


      **Yunjin** - Another support that Kuki can utilize. Her flat DMG increase
      via her DEF greatly increases Kuki’s Normal ATK DMG and with her A4
      passive on a Rainbow comp, her being on C6, can boost it further. It
      cannot be understated how important Yunjin is for Kuki’s personal damage,
      due to Kuki’s naturally low multipliers. Any teammates that give flat DMG
      increase will help Kuki substantially.

      **Mono-Electro Teams (ex. Yae, Raiden, Kuki Shinobu, Kazuha)** - removing
      Sara and Jean to make way for Kuki and Kazuha actually helps the rotation
      timing and DMG a lot. You do not need to manage Sara spreading her ATK
      Buff to both Yae and Raiden simultaneously. This team provides enough
      sustain to keep both Yae and Raiden alive with Kuki’s healing and has 100%
      healing (at C2+) and buffing uptime with Tenacity of the Millelith.


      **Support for Superconduct Team (ex. Eula, Kuki Shinobu, Flex, Flex)** -
      She is good as a substitute to other Electro units who need to be on
      another team. With her healing, she can sustain the DPS on-field time
      doing Physical DMG while buffing with Tenacity of the Millelith or dealing
      DMG with Ocean-Hued Clam.


      **Overload Team (ex. Kuki Shinobu, Bennett, Xiangling, Anemo)** - This
      team composition usually makes Kuki Shinobu trigger the reaction and every
      party member sets it up for her. There is no one stealing ownership as
      Kuki will be running solo Electro. Her only flaw in this composition is
      her ER Requirement as she will be running solo electro to maintain the
      ownership. Additionally, Bennett/Xiangling/Anemo has many, many characters
      that can fill this slot better than Shinobu can. When using Kuki in this
      comp, it’s important to wait to use her skill until *after* her Burst
      finishes, in order to maximize application.


      **Electro-Charged Team (ex. Tartaglia, Kuki Shinobu, Electro, Flex)** -
      This team usually will force Kuki Shinobu with another Electro to maintain
      the Electro-Charged Reaction. While the ownership for this reaction is
      quite hard to manage, Kuki provides a lot of sustain but lessens the DMG
      compared to say, like Beidou or Fischl.


      **Mono-Geo Comp (ex. Itto, Gorou, Zhongli, Kuki Shinobu)** - Primarily,
      her role here is a dedicated healer and buffer. Opens up Bennett or
      another healer to be in a different team and she performs really well as
      Itto moves a lot during his time on the field.



      **Physical Team (ex. Kuki Shinobu, Rosaria, Yunjin, Fischl/Bennett)** -
      Rather than use Rosaria or Fischl as Physical DPS units, we use them here
      as DPS’s in their respective element to facilitate Superconduct while
      dealing satisfying damage individually. The healing comes from Kuki and
      Yunjin’s Burst can double her DPS. Fischl can be swapped with Bennett
      according to team needs. In order to reach DPS thresholds, however, your
      supports should also be especially well-invested here.
