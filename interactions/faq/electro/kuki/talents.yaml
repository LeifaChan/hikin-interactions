      Leveling Priority:

      **E > Q > AA**


      Kuki Shinobu’s kit entirely relies on her healing via her Elemental Skill,
      which is why it is likely to be prioritized. Her Elemental Burst and Auto
      Attack scalings are quite low and aren’t worth investment except for
      die-hard Shinobu fans. For a DPS Based Kuki, you have 2 options to go to:
      Physical Based DPS and Reaction-based DPS. 


      Physical DPS Kuki focuses more on her Normal and Charged Attacks while
      playing as a Reaction DPS focuses more on her building EM. If you choose
      to play her this way, her Normal Attack talent deserves priority. 


      Reaction-based DPS essentially does not need to level up her talents as
      you just need to focus on getting a high EM baseline.


      Her Elemental Skill summons a ring of Electro Naku Weed around the
      character, dealing DMG on the initial casting of it based on her ATK.
      Furthermore, the elemental skill will tick DMG whether Kuki is on the
      field or not, dealing Electro DMG based on her ATK and healing the active
      character based on Kuki’s Max HP. Her Elemental Burst is quite similar to
      Amber’s Elemental Burst. If she is above 50% of her Max HP, her Elemental
      Burst ticks 7 times. Below 50% of her Max HP, her Elemental Burst ticks 13
      times.

      __***Passive Talents***__
      
      Her A1 and A4 basically are just boost to her healing apart from the A4
      increasing her Elemental Skill DMG via her EM. Her A1 increases her
      Healing Bonus by 15% if she is below 50% of her Max HP. Plain and simple
      to understand. Her A4 is a flat boost to her healing and DMG. The added
      healing amount of her Elemental Skill w/ A4 scales with her EM at 75% of
      it and the added DMG dealt to enemies of her Elemental Skill w/ A4 also
      scales with her EM at 25% instead. Assuming this is a flat values buff
      rather than additive values, this passive is currently one of her
      unnecessary traits, due to its low impact on damage and healing.
