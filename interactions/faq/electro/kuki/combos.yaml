    description: >-
      Kuki Shinobu, as a support and/or reaction DPS, will most often be casting
      her Skill, occasionally casting her Burst, and switching out. As an
      on-field physical DPS, her rotation depends on whether you use Yunjin as a
      teammate and/or Haran Geppaku Futsu as a weapon. Normally, her best Normal
      Attack combo is **N1C spam.** However, with Yunjin and/or Haran, her best
      Normal Attack combo is **N4D spam.**
