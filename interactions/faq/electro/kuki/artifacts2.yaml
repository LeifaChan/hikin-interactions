    description: >-
      **4PC Tenacity of the Millelith** - Her BiS artifact. It gives HP% on its
      2PC and gives an ATK and Shield Strength Buff if Elemental Skill deals DMG
      to an enemy on its 4PC. Kuki can easily trigger the 4PC passive as her
      Elemental Skill ticks enough to keep the buff uptime at 100% at C2. 


      **4PC Noblesse Oblige** -  An artifact set that any support unit can carry
      due to its team-wide ATK% buff. Not the best option, but not a bad one
      either. The 20% ATK Buff helps the whole party in exchange to Kuki
      Bursting to get the buff.


      **4PC Ocean-Hued Clam** - This set allows Kuki to deal DMG while also
      maintaining her role as a support. The only caveat that this artifact set
      has is that Kuki can not reach the maximum healing threshold that this set
      has, meaning she deals less DMG compared to other healers that use this
      set overall. In niche situations, such as in a Eula team where there is
      already a Tenacity-holder, this could, in theory, put in some work.


      **4PC Maiden’s Beloved** - This set maximizes her healing potential as its
      4PC ties down to her healing capabilities. Only downside this set has is
      there is no  buff on the party compared to Tenacity of the Millelith and
      Ocean-Hued Clam. It is a comfort set for her to boost her healing in
      certain situations.


      **4PC The Exile** - A good 4* option to help batterying certain units when
      using Kuki Shinobu. Only downside for this set is that her healing will be
      a little lower since the HP% ratio between a 4* vs a 5* is a huge
      difference. When using 4pc Exile, use a 5* flower as the off-set piece.


      **4PC Instructor** - Another good 4* option and an underrated artifact set
      in general. She must be the one triggering reactions for the 4PC of this
      set to be proc, but the 180 EM buff applies to all characters on your
      team. Provides good EM on 2PC and can be used for reaction-based comps.

      For DPS Kuki, we split the categories based on what type of DPS Kuki
      people will be running. This is done so everyone can know what her BiS in
      certain sections of DPS are.


      Physical DPS Kuki:
    description: >-
      **4PC Pale Flame** - Her BiS in the Physical DPS Role. She can easily proc
      the 4PC Passive just like Tenacity of the Millelith. This set generally
      will be available at anyones disposal as if both are dedicated to farm for
      both Support Kuki and Physical DPS Kuki on one domain,  making this option
      particularly resin-efficient.


      **4PC Gladiator’s Finale** - This set generally is an easy access set due
      to the strongbox being available to everyone. Along with any artifacts you
      are trying to farm for Kuki, you can recycle them into Gladiator’s Finale
      if you did not get the right mainstats or substats for your artifacts for
      her. In deviant builds, this can substitute for Pale Flame for similar
      damage without drawback.


      **4PC Shimenawa Reminiscence** - Provides a huge boost of NA and CA DMG%.
      The 4PC Elemental Burst Energy loss does not generally affect her overall
      DMG on a Physical Kuki as the Elemental Burst is not triggered due to Kuki
      building No HP% for this type of DPS. In deviant builds, this can
      substitute for Pale Flame for the same damage, as long as you can pay the
      energy cost.


      **2PC Pale Flame 2PC Bloodstained Chivalry** - the 50% Physical DMG Bonus
      provides Kuki a huge amount of DMG Bonus with just two 2PC sets, easy to
      farm as you can get 2PC Bloodstained Chivalry on the strongbox while
      farming 2PC Pale Flame.


      **2PC ATK% x2** - Either Gladiator’s Finale, Shimenawa Reminiscence,
      Echoes of an Offering, Vermillion Hereafter. Any 2PC 2PC of these sets are
      fine. This provides her enough ATK% if running a Physical DMG Sword such
      as Prototype Rancour or Aquilla Favonia.


      **2PC Physical DMG% 2PC ATK%** - A mix-mix set between all the artifacts
      mentioned above. Viable in most cases but getting 4PC’s is highly
      recommended. This set most likely will be least functional than the other
      artifacts given since Shinobu’s gear must not be neglected to make her
      usable

  - title: 'Reaction-based Kuki:'
    description: >-
      **4PC Thundering Fury** - Her BiS in reaction-based comps. 4PC passive
      allows her Elemental Skill CD go from 15 seconds to 10 seconds with
      reaction procing 5 times due to her ICD. Along with this, Overload and
      Electro-charged DMG are increased with the 4PC set active.


      **4PC Tenacity of the Millelith** - Due to its 4PC ATK% Buff, it generally
      helps the party gain more buff, along with a slight DMG increase on Kuki
      Shinobu’s Elemental Burst DMG due to the HP% that Tenacity of the
      Millelith gives.


      **4PC Lavawalker** - Just like Thundersoother, this set gives her a good
      amount of DMG in Overload Comps. Farming Lavawalker can be a pain, but
      using Lavawalker on Kuki and Crimson Witch of Flames on your Pyro Sub-DPS
      is generally a good idea but there are always better options.


      **4PC Thundersoother** - Alongside farming Thunderfury, this set’s 4PC
      provides a good amount of DMG for Kuki in Electro-Charged Comps
      specifically. Really good option if all the farmed Thundering Fury are
      trash and you got good Thundersoother pieces to use.


      **2PC Wanderer Troupe, 2PC Thundering Fury** - A good half and half sets
      that can be used by her. 80+ EM generally is good below <= 490 EM, but
      Kuki will be running triple EM as well as in the substats for the Flower
      and Feather. This artifact option is on the low side as farming 4PC’s
      tends to bring much more outcome in terms of DMG, but this option is
      easier to farm as Wanderers Troupe is in the strongbox.
