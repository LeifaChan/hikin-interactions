      Support Kuki

      **4PC Tenacity of the Millelith** 
    description: >-
      Her BiS artifact. It gives HP% on its 2PC and gives an ATK and Shield Strength Buff if Elemental Skill deals DMG to an enemy on its 4PC. Kuki can easily trigger the 4PC passive as her Elemental Skill ticks enough to keep the buff uptime at 100% at C2.

      **4PC Noblesse Oblige**
    description: >- 
      An artifact set that any support unit can carry due to its team-wide ATK% buff. Not the best option, but not a bad one either. The 20% ATK Buff helps the whole party in exchange to Kuki Bursting to get the buff.

      **4PC Ocean-Hued Clam**
    description: >-
      This set allows Kuki to deal DMG while also maintaining her role as a support. The only caveat that this artifact set has is that Kuki can not reach the maximum healing threshold that this set has, meaning she deals less DMG compared to other healers that use this set overall. In niche situations, such as in a Eula team where there is already a Tenacity-holder, this could, in theory, put in some work.

      **4PC Maiden’s Beloved**
    description: >-
      This set maximizes her healing potential as its 4PC ties down to her healing capabilities. Only downside this set has is there is no  buff on the party compared to Tenacity of the Millelith and Ocean-Hued Clam. It is a comfort set for her to boost her healing in certain situations.

      **4PC The Exile**
    description: >-
      A good 4* option to help batterying certain units when using Kuki Shinobu. Only downside for this set is that her healing will be a little lower since the HP% ratio between a 4* vs a 5* is a huge difference. When using 4pc Exile, use a 5* flower as the off-set piece.

      **4PC Instructor**
    description: >-
      Another good 4* option and an underrated artifact set in general. She must be the one triggering reactions for the 4PC of this set to be proc, but the 180 EM buff applies to all characters on your team. Provides good EM on 2PC and can be used for reaction-based comps.
