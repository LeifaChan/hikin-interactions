      **The Black Sword**
    description: >-
      Same as Aquilla Favonia’s Passive, the healing from this weapon counts into Ocean-Hued Clam’s DMG. Not only that, the Normal and Charged ATK% Buff along with it helps her DMG and being a 4* Crit stat stick helps the healing passive more often to proc. The Black Sword is the easiest 4-star weapon to build with, due to it’s CRIT Rate secondary stat, and outperforms all other 4-stars when max-refined.

      *Reaction-Based Weapon*

      **Freedom Sworn**
    description: >-
      Her BiS for reaction damage, due to having the most amount of EM that Kuki could use to deal a ton of Transformative Reactions. It also brings a teamwide ATK% Buff and DMG% bonus for Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks. It is also the 5-star BiS for Support builds.

      **Iron Sting**
    description: >-
      Her 4* F2P option. The EM on this weapon is really good to use and its passive really compliments Kuki’ Shinobu's lack of DMG% with triple EM. With refinements, her DMG really ups a lot.

      **Favonius Sword**
    description: >-
      The Favonius Sword is her best support weapon, yes, but also takes care of all of the Energy Recharge requirements for Shinobu, allowing her to run a full EM build. It is 2% less damage than an R1 Iron Sting, but also serves to battery the party. A solid option.

      **Lion’s Roar**
    description: >-
      A conditional weapon. This weapon can compete DMG if the passive uptime is 100%. The stat that goes along with it is not necessary but can amp up her Elemental Skill DMG. Generally, this underperforms even at high refinements compared to the 3-star Dark Iron Sword

      **Festering Desire**
    description: >-
      Another F2P option that you can use. Provides a good ER amount, passive is really good in terms of Kuki’s source of DMG, and everyone gets R5 for free (unless you played after 1.2). Generally, this weapon focuses more on her Elemental Skill than her Elemental Burst, which in an triple EM Kuki, will lack on the Elemental Burst side of DMG.

      **Dark Iron Sword**
    description: >-
      3* option. The EM on this weapon surpasses The Alley Flash’s EM and provides an ATK% Buff which Kuki can use to further up her DMG. For reactions, the sword’s passive is rarely relevant. It is the bare minimum option when you have no crafting materials to spare and there is no Favonius Sword to speak of.
