      ***Healing Support Kuki - 4pc Tenacity of the
      Millelith***
    description: >-
      For a ***Healing Support Kuki,*** we recommend the ***4pc Tenacity of the
      Millelith*** artifact set, as her skill can consistently maintain the
      set’s 20% ATK bonus for her team. The Healing Support build follows these
      mainstats and substats prioritization


      ***Sands - HP%

      Goblet - HP%

      Circlet - HB%


      Substats:

      HP%>CR%>ER%>EM***


      CR% being on secondary priority as Favonius Sword is her BiS on the 4*
      sword options that Kuki can use as a Healing Support. Rotations with
      Favonius Sword will force Kuki to Elemental Burst to trigger a 1/7 chance
      to proc Favonius Passive.

      ***Physical DPS Kuki : 4pc Pale Flame***
    description: >-
      For a ***Physical DPS Kuki,*** we recommend the ***4pc Pale Flame***
      artifact set, as it adds the most total relevant stats. Physical Kuki
      heavily relies on her long physical field time along with weapons that
      correspond to this type of DMG. She uses her auto attack combos all the
      way until the buffs that she receives expire and force her to rotate out. 


      The build follows these mainstat and substat priorities:


      ***Sands - ATK%

      Goblet -Physical DMG%

      Circlet - CR%


      Substats Priority:

      CR%=CDMG%>ATK%***

  - title : Gladiator 4pc and Shimenawa 4pc
    description: >-
      “Deviant” builds utilizing either Chongyun or C6 Bennett will require an
      appropriate goblet and artifact set change (Gladiator/Shime 4pc sets), but
      these are generally ill-advised on characters anyways.

      ***Reaction DPS Kuki - Triple EM***
    description: >-
      ***Reaction DPS Kuki*** will need a full triple-EM investment, and these
      artifacts are very difficult to find in order to have comparable (or even
      less!) damage than other builds. For the **most personal damage**, ***4pc
      Thundering Fury*** will work fine. However, it’s possible that ***4pc
      Tenacity of the Millelith*** will add more Team DPS at the cost of her
      personal damage. 


      Reaction-based Kuki relies on her procing the reactions due to her
      Elemental Skill ticking at 1.5 seconds on a 12 second duration. This
      reaction-based reactions mostly consist of Overload comps and sometimes
      Electro-Charged comps.


      **This build will require Kuki to have a ER Weapon. Running ER/EM/EM with
      a EM weapon is the same balance as triple EM with ER weapon,



      Substats Priority:

      EM>>ER%>HP%>ATK%(Triple EM Build with ER Weapon)

      ER%>EM>ATK%>HP% (ER/EM/EM with EM Weapon)**

      **DISCLAIMER:**
    description: >-
      Please keep in mind that the most you are likely to see
      with Overload reactions is about 20k damage per reaction. With standard
      ICD, Shinobu would max out at ~80k damage on a Elemental Burst if Shinobu
      can claim ownership on every reaction, she has the best artifacts and
      weapons possible, and there is adequate pyro application to last through
      Shinobu’s Burst.


      **Regarding Intensify, will still need further testing on the reaction
      itself before doing update on this specific build for Kuki. Please take
      note that the information we have got is not complete and will be changed
      in the future depending on what Mihoyo takes it.**


      Her Artifact options also depend on what you will run Kuki as. Here are
      some options on the artifacts for Kuki whether you are playing her as a
      Support or DPS.
