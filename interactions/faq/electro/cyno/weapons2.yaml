      __***Options***__
      **Vortex Vanquisher**
    description: >-
      Good 5* option when a shielder is at the party. Able to provide 49.6% ATK
      while its passive also gives more ATK% via hits on the enemy. Passive fits
      well with Cyno’s playstyle and he can easily maximize the buff along with
      Zhongli, one of the units that Cyno would want as his shield has the
      longest duration and being strong enough to withstand attacks.

  - title: '**Calamity Queller**'
    description: >-
      Provides the highest amount of Base ATK out of all the 5* weapon. Gives
      out 12% Elemental DMG Bonus and stackable ATK% when Elemental Skill was
      casted. The stackable ATK% takes quite a time to max out so be wary of
      that when using this weapon.

  - title: '**Engulfing Lightning**'
    description: >-
      Really good 5* option when you are forcing Cyno as the solo Electro unit.
      Grants him 55.1% ER, converts ER to ATK%, and gives 30% ER after casting
      Elemental Burst. It has more value when Cyno needs to meet his ER
      requirements but usually is just an option when he does not have a battery
      to go with him.

  - title: '**Skyward Spine**'
    description: >-
      Same category as Engulfing Lightning, which suffices for Cyno’s ER
      requirement. Provides 36.8% ER, CR%, ATK SPD%, and another source of DMG
      with its vacuum blade that triggers every 2s. Cyno needs a new rotation
      for this weapon to maximize its potential but currently its only use is
      its ER% and CR% built in the weapon.

  - title: '**Lithic Spear**'
    description: >-
      Only viable when 1-2 Liyue character are in Cyno’s team. Able to give
      27.6% ATK and stackable ATK% and CR% based on how many Liyue character are
      in your party puts this weapon quite on the niche side of his options.

  - title: '**Kitain Cross Spear**'
    description: >-
      The Inazuma Polearm craftable. Gives out 110 EM, Elemental Skill DMG%, and
      Flat Energy that has a draining mechanic. If one performs __**EQ
      Mechanic**__ with this weapon, there could be slight problems with the
      Elemental Burst casting after Elemental Skill Cast so be wary of using
      this weapon with this caveat.

  - title: '**Moonpiercer**'
    description: >-
      The Sumeru Polearm craftable. Grants him 110 EM and a leaf that provides
      ATK% after picking it up. To get said leaf, one must trigger a Dendro
      Reaction and have a CD of 20s for another leaf to be triggered. Really
      fits well with Cyno on Aggravate teams as he will mostly catch the leaf
      himself during Pactsworn Pathclearer state.

  - title: '**Missive Windblade**'
    description: >-
      Another F2P option that will be given during 3.1. Gives out 41.3% ATK, and
      more ATK% and EM after triggering a Elemental Reactionl but has a duration
      of 10s per buff so Cyno won’t have 100% uptime on this weapon buff.

      __***Situational***__
      **Dragon’s Bane**
    description: >-
      A really outstanding weapon to use on him when he is abusing
      Transformative Reactions. Able to provide 221 EM and DMG% to enemies
      affected by Hydro or Pyro, making this weapon a really good option for
      Electro-Charged, and Overvape teams and the EM goes well with Hyperbloom
      teams.
