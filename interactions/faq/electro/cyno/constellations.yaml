      __**CONSTELLATION**__

      **C1**
    description: >-
      *After using Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness, Cyno's Normal Attack SPD will
      be increased by 20% for 10s. If the Judication effect of his Passive
      Talent Featherfall Judgment is triggered during Secret Rite: Chasmic
      Soulfarer, the duration of this increase will be refreshed. You need to
      unlock the Passive Talent "Featherfall Judgment."*


      This constellation allows Cyno to deal more on-field damage due to the ATK
      SPD given upon casting Elemental Burst or triggering A1 through his
      Elemental Skill. Combos for this constellation are posted in the Combo
      Section of this FAQ. Overall, a decent constellation to acquire.

      *When Cyno's Normal Attacks hit opponents, he gains 10% Electro DMG
      respectively for 4s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 5
      stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.*


      A strong point in his constellations. Able to provide a huge amount of
      Electro DMG with ease makes this constellation of value quite high and a
      good stop point for people who would want to get Cyno Constellations.

    description: >-
      *Increases the Level of Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness by 3. Maximum
      upgrade level is 15.*


      Standard +3 Constellation. Increase Elemental Burst MVs, which means
      stronger damage outputted by his Elemental Burst Normal Attacks.

      *When Cyno is in the Pactsworn Pathclearer state triggered by Sacred Rite:
      Wolf's Swiftness, after he triggers Electro-Charged, Superconduct,
      Overloaded, Quicken, Aggravate, Hyperbloom, an Electro Swirl or an Electro
      Crystallization reaction, he will restore 3 Elemental Energy for all
      nearby party members (except himself.). This effect can occur 5 times
      within one use of Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness.*


      This constellation turns Cyno into a semi-battery for his party members.
      Granting a 15 energy that would make his support’s ER requirement lower
      with his current rotation time. Overall, not a bad constellation on teams
      that are suffering in ER requirements due to Cyno’s long field-time

      *Increases the Level of Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer by 3. Maximum
      upgrade level is 15.*


      Standard +3 Constellation. Increase Elemental Skill MVs, which means
      stronger damage outputted by his Elemental Skill outside of Pactsworn
      Pathclearer and when in Pactsworn Pathclearer state.

      *After using Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness or triggering the Judication
      effect of the Passive Talent "Featherfall Judgment," Cyno will gain 4
      stacks of the "Day of the Jackal" effect. When he hits opponents with
      Normal Attacks, he will consume 1 stack of "Day of the Jackal" to fire off
      one Duststalker Bolt. "Day of the Jackal" lasts for 8s. Max 8 stacks. It
      will be cancelled once Pactsworn Pathclearer ends. A maximum of 1
      Duststalker Bolt can be unleashed this way every 0.4s. You must first
      unlock the Passive Talent "Featherfall Judgment."*


      This constellation provides more A1 Bolt when hitting enemies with Normal
      Attack in Pactsworn Pathclearer state and having Day of the Jackal effect
      active. A total of 15-20 bolts can be achieved depending on how much field
      time Cyno will take throughout his rotation. This constellation ICD is
      separated with his A1 ICD so it does not mess up ICD procs of A1.
