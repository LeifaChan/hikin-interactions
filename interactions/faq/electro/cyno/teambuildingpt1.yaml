      __**TEAM BUILDING**__

      __***Electro***__
      **Fischl**
    description: >-
      Super strong unit that makes Cyno’s ER requirement lower to non-existent
      depends on whether you have her on C6 or not and is able to provide a good
      amount of damage coming from her versatile kit ranging from her Elemental
      Skill to her C6. Her only caveat is Oz is mostly Single Target (ST) so in
      scenarios where 2 or more targets are present, she will fall behind in
      damage.

  - title: '**Beidou**'
    description: >-
      Super reliable at 2 or more target scenarios due to her Elemental Burst
      functionality and her constellation improves her team composition along
      with Cyno’s overall damage. However, she suffers being on Cyno’s team due
      to both having a high energy Elemental Burst cost and both has weak
      particle generation, which means their ER requirements will be quite high.

  - title: '**Yae**'
    description: >-
      Can act as a dual carry but suffers the same reason as Beidou with ER
      requirements being high but that can be negated with casting Elemental
      Burst every other rotation to suffice for the ER requirement. Overall, she
      is a solid unit to substitute to Fischl when she is on another team
      composition.

  - title: '**Kuki Shinobu**'
    description: >-
      Works really well with Cyno as her Elemental Skill follows the character
      itself, which means he is not locked into a certain field where he has to
      stay to either get buffs or heal. She can also carry Favonius Sword or
      Xiphos’ Moonlight for helping party members ER requirements. However, when
      she carries Tenacity of the Millelith, she can’t quite buff Cyno’s whole
      field time, due to her Elemental Skill having a 12s duration.

  - title: '**Dori**'
    description: >-
      A substitute if Kuki Shinobu is not available to your party. However, in
      order for her to provide healing, she needs to cast her Elemental Burst
      unlike Shinobu. Her only potential in Cyno team composition is her C4
      providing a stronger heal when Cyno is below 30% HP and ER% when Cyno’s
      Elemental Burst energy is below 30, which makes Cyno’s ER requirement
      non-existent in team compositions that are quite low on particle
      generation.

      __***Dendro***__
      **Dendro MC**
    description: >-
      The only Dendro unit that can keep up with Cyno’s long-field time with
      their C2 due to how their Elemental Burst interacts with Electro as it
      increases the Elemental Burst ATK SPD, which allows it to bypass its
      Standard ICD. With their A4 providing EM as well throughout the duration
      of their Elemental Burst, Half of Cyno’s rotation will get buff with that
      passive and helps increase Cyno’s A4 and Aggravate DMG.

  - title: '**Collei**'
    description: >-
      The second Dendro unit in the game that currently can keep up with Cyno’s
      long-field time but is outperformed by Dendro MC due to how her burst
      functions with its ICD. Even at C6, she struggles to keep up with Dendro
      MC’s Dendro application with her 2.5s ICD on her Elemental Burst.

  - title: '**Tighnari**'
    description: >-
      Can act as a dual carry and provides good damage output with his low-field
      time requirement. However, most of this time Cyno’s field-time is cut off
      in order to fill Tighnari’s full combo in the rotation which would hurt
      Cyno’s overall damage as he needs a certain amount of time on-field as
      well as Tighnari’s overall damage as he usually needs a short team
      rotation.
