  - title: __**CHARACTER OVERVIEW**__
    description: >-
      Cyno is a 5* Electro Main DPS, and is considered to be an Electro
      Hypercarry. He relies on his teammates giving him buffs throughout his
      Elemental Burst duration, which is where the majority of his damage comes
      from, with both his A1 and A4 passive focusing on specific mechanics tied
      to his Elemental Burst. However, this comes at a cost: Cyno needs to spend
      a large amount of time on the field to maximize his damage potential,
      making his supports take a toll in terms of the requirements such as their
      ER requirement and overall damage.. Nevertheless, his needs are super
      accessible to anyone with White Tassel, a 3* weapon, which is competitive
      even with some of his 4* options, and when it comes to his team
      compositions, Cyno’s ideal teams lean primarily towards Aggravate Teams or
      Transformative Teams.


      Cyno’s kit gets the most utility out of the 4PC Thundering Fury set, as
      this set makes great use of Cyno’s overall playstyle. This set heavily
      affects his short Elemental Skill cooldown on his Elemental Burst duration
      along with timing TF Procs with a specific combo that you should run on
      him. However, the A1 passive poses a challenge to some of Cyno’s combos,
      as it has a specific timing regarding its procs and it is not tied to
      anything, only on specific intervals. This makes Cyno a hard challenge to
      TC as mapping out TF procs, ICD procs, and A1 procs along with the
      rotation time is quite hard due to many reasons such as MV/s, ICD procs,
      etc.
