      2 Electro w/ Fischl: **120 - 140%**

      1 Electro w/ Fischl: **130 - 150%**

      Everything else: **140 - 160%**


      Every Favonius proc lowers his ER requirements by ~10 – 20%

      If using R1 Tome of the Eternal Flow, reduce each ER requirement by
      30-40%. If using R5 Prototype Amber, reduce them by about 35-45%. .


      Except in teams where Neuvillette only does 2 CAs per rotation (which are
      very rare), it is absolutely essential that Neuvillette have enough ER to
      Burst consistently every rotation; otherwise, he will not have enough
      Sourcewater Droplets to lower all his CA charging times.


      Neuvillette’s Energy requirements will vary based on your team and
      rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge
      calculator linked
