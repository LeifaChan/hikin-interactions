    description: "### Neuvillette | Fischl | Yae Miko or Beidou | Flex\nNeuvillette Taser teams feature Yae or Beidou as an off-field DPS, with Neuvillette to deal damage on-field and Fischl as a battery.\t\t\t\n\nBeidou excels in multi-target situations, providing off-field damage with her Burst. Neuvillette can trigger her Burst procs decently well with his Charged Attacks. She also provides interruption resistance and a shield (albeit a weak one) with her C1, potentially allowing C0 Neuvillette to comfortably run without a shielder.\n\nYae Miko also provides off-field damage, although she lacks the utilities Beidou has.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex options:** Kazuha, Venti, Zhongli, any Anemo with 4pc VV, Mona/Xingqiu/Yelan"

      ### Neuvillette | Xiangling | Bennett | Flex

      It can be difficult to control who ends up Vaporizing out of Neuvillette
      and Xiangling — once an aura is established, neither of them can overtake
      the other — but it actually doesn't matter because the team ends up doing
      the same damage anyways! A decent option with AoE on both its main damage
      dealers, although Xiangling's Burst requiring Neuvillette to play in melee
      range negates the benefits of his range and makes some form of
      interruption resistance much more valuable.

      ### Neuvillette | Cryo | Flex | Flex

      Neuvillette can make sure of Freeze in scenarios against freezable
      enemies, giving extra CC to his teams that may allow some players to run
      him shielderless at C0. However, players still have access to shielders
      such as Diona and Layla for Cryo resonance and defensive utility. Keep in
      mind, quite a few recent enemies, as well as bosses, can’t be frozen,
      making this playstyle limited in uses. On top of this, there are few Cryo
      off-field characters who work well with Neuvillette’s range, resulting in
      quite limited team options.
