          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions.

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Neuvillette is a 5-star Pneuma-aligned Hydro Catalyst whose kit revolves
      around unleashing high-powered, long-ranged Charged Attacks. His Skill and
      Burst can create Sourcewater Droplets, which heal him and decrease his
      Charged Attacks’ wind-up time. Neuvillette’s attacks all have a large AoE,
      and his Charged Attack can pierce through enemies, allowing him to hit
      multiple enemies at once. 


      As an on-field Hydro DPS, Neuvillette has a large variety of teams. Since
      Neuvillette’s Charged Attacks can be interrupted, which leads to huge
      losses in damage, he has a high reliance on shielders at C0. High field
      time requirements, a long Skill cooldown, and an expensive Burst also tend
      to make his rotations rather long. Due to this and the fact he scales off
      of HP, as of 4.1, Neuvillette lacks strong buffers outside of Kazuha —
      thus, many of his teams feature off-field damage dealers.
