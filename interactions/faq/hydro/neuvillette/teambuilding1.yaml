    description: "Being an on-field Hydro character opens Neuvillette up to a wide variety of team compositions that take advantage of various reactions. \n\t\nBecause Neuvillette heals himself (and also because trying to heal someone who constantly loses over 4000 HP per second is a futile endeavor), most of his teams can forgo a healer in place of a more offensively-oriented unit. However, because Neuvillette is easily knocked over while charging and casting his Charged Attacks — causing you to lose all the damage from that Charged Attack — he often wants a shielder or another character who can provide interruption resistance. This problem is mostly mitigated by C1.\t\n\nIt is recommended for Neuvillette to do 3 or 4 Charged Attacks per rotation in almost all of his teams, by doing 2 Charged Attacks the first time he enters the field, swapping out to his teammates, and then doing either 1 or 2 Charged Attacks when he next returns to field. Most teams will use some variation of: Neuvillette Burst > Team > Neuvillette CA Skill CA > Team > Neuvillette CA Skill (Optional CA) > Loop."

      ### Neuvillette | Kazuha | Offensive Flex | Offensive or Defensive Flex

      Due to Neuvillette's high personal damage, teams that focus on buffing his
      personal damage can be quite potent. Hypercarry teams scale well with
      Constellations and investment into Neuvi, but he currently lacks many
      options to buff his damage outside of Kazuha, providing both DMG Bonus as
      well as RES Shred from 4 VV. Other Hydro characters such as Xingqiu or
      Yelan can provide DMG Bonus or Hydro RES Shred but aren’t ideal due to
      requiring Normal Attack weaving to make full use of their Elemental
      Bursts. Mona can also provide a similar amount of DMG Bonus to Yelan
      without weaving in Normal Attacks for extra damage. Currently, it is
      recommended to slot him with other Sub DPS characters due to his lack of
      self-buffing options.

      ### Neuvillette | Dendro | Electro | Flex

      Neuvillette Hyperbloom teams utilize his on-field Hydro application in
      tandem with off-field Dendro application to trigger Blooms and
      subsequently Hyperblooms with an Electro unit for a good mix of AoE and
      single-target damage.

      ### Neuvillette | Nilou | Core Dendro | 2nd Dendro

      Neuvillette can provide on-field AoE Hydro application for Nilou Bloom
      teams, which excel in multi-target. Because Bloom does a fair amount of
      damage to characters themselves, players may want a healer to supplement
      Neuvillette's own healing. Neuvillette's build does not change in Nilou
      Bloom teams, even if he is triggering Blooms (although EM becomes a decent
      stat to have).
