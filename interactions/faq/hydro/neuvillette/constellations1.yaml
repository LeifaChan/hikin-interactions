      **Constellation 1 - Venerable Institution**
    description: >-
      > *When Neuvillette takes the field, he will obtain 1 stack of Past
      Draconic Glories from the Passive Talent "Heir to the Ancient Sea's
      Authority." You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Heir to the Ancient
      Sea's Authority."

      > Additionally, his interruption resistance will be increased while using
      the Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation and the Charged Attack:
      Equitable Judgment.*


      C1 offers both a respectable DPS increase and a valuable QoL improvement.
      The damage increase C1 provides may be even greater if it allows you to
      swap a defensive unit for a buffer or sub-DPS.


      However, his C1 may not provide any bonus damage if run in teams where his
      A1 Passive is already maximized. Further, the QoL it brings can also be
      unnecessary if getting staggered is not a concern; for example, when he is
      paired with units that already provide ample crowd control or interruption
      resistance.

      C2 increases the value of C1's additional A1 stack by offering CRIT DMG
      per stack of A1. Otherwise, it's a relatively straightforward damage
      increase.
