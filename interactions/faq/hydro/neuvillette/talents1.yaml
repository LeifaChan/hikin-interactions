      __TALENT PRIORITY__

      **Normal Attack > Elemental Burst = Elemental Skill**
    description: >-
      ## __Analysis__

      - Neuvillette's Charged Attacks are his main source of damage, so his
      Normal Attack Talent should be leveled first. Neither his Skill nor his
      Burst contribute significant amounts of damage, but are still used to
      generate Sourcewater Droplets, so they can be leveled afterwards in
      tandem.

      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: As Water Seeks Equilibrium**
    description: >-
      Neuvillette's Charged Attacks are the main attraction of his kit, boasting
      continuous, HP-scaling, AoE damage that pierces enemies in its range. He
      relies on absorbing 3 Sourcewater Droplets for every CA, which are
      primarily generated through his own Skill and Burst. These Droplets reduce
      the initial wind-up of his CA from 4s to 1s, and heal off the massive HP
      penalty incurred while casting it.


      Neuvillette can absorb any Sourcewater Droplets, including those not
      generated by himself. However, as of 4.1, the only other character who can
      generate Droplets is Hydro Traveler, and it is not recommended to use
      Hydro Traveler with Neuvillette, as they provide too little else, and
      Neuvillette already generates sufficient Droplets on his own.
