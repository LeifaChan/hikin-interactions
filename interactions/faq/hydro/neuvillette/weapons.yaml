      **Tome of the Eternal Flow**
    description: >-
      Tome of the Eternal Flow is Neuvillette’s BiS and signature weapon,
      providing a little of everything that Neuvillette could want: high CRIT
      DMG%, HP%, CA DMG%, and enough Energy to lower his ER reqs to 100% in most
      teams. TotEF is significantly better (30-40%) than all other options
      except Sacrificial Jade (TotEF is 20% better than R1 Sac Jade, and only 7%
      better than R5 Sac Jade).

    description: >-
      Sacrificial Jade is Neuvillette’s second-best weapon, providing both CRIT
      Rate and HP%. At R1, It is about 10% better than the next best option, so
      it may be a worthwhile purchase for players who do not have TotEF. Sac
      Jade scales well with refines, which increase the amount of HP% it
      provides to Neuvillette. Players using Sacrificial Jade should be mindful
      of keeping Neuvillette on the field for no longer than 10s at a time, to
      ensure that he does not lose its passive effect (EQ CAx2, for example,
      would be too long).

      **Cashflow Supervision / Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds / Jadefall
      Splendor / Everlasting Moonglow / Kagura’s Verity**
    description: >-
      All of these 5-star weapons perform similarly on Neuvillette, providing
      some amount of CRIT Rate or HP%, as well as small bonuses from their
      passives.

  - title: '**Prototype Amber**'
    description: >-
      Prototype Amber performs similarly or slightly better than the 5-star
      weapons listed directly above, provided that Neuvillette can use the
      energy its passive provides. Otherwise, it still offers Neuvillette a
      hefty amount of HP%, as well as some passive healing. Though this healing
      is too miniscule and infrequent to be of much use to Neuvillette himself,
      it can be helpful to heal chip damage on teammates as Neuvillette’s teams
      tend to lack healers.
