      **4PC Marechaussee Hunter**
    description: >-
      4pc MH is Neuvillette’s BiS by a sizable margin; it is over 12% better
      than the next best option. Neuvillette can fully stack the 4pc MH effect
      very quickly because of the HP loss during his Charged Attack. It is
      highly recommended to farm this set for Neuvillette.

      4pc HoD is Neuvillette’s best option after 4pc MH, providing Hydro DMG%
      and Charged Attack DMG%.
