      **Ascension 1 Passive: Heir to the Ancient Sea's Authority**
    description: >-
      A1 is a multiplicative DMG bonus (like Yoimiya's or Wanderer's Skills) for
      Neuvillette's CA that stacks up to 3 times for every unique reaction
      involving Hydro. 


      The difference between different numbers of stacks is substantial, but not
      necessarily worth forcing team comps that maximize the number of stacks.

    description: >-
      Since absorbed Sourcewater Droplets heal Neuvillette at the beginning of
      his CA (and not during), Neuvillette will lose this bonus over the course
      of his CA without external healing. Nonetheless, it is an appreciated
      albeit minor increase to his damage.

      Neuvillette increases the underwater sprinting speed of the party by 15%,
      giving players an easier time when exploring Fontaine’s new underwater
      areas.
