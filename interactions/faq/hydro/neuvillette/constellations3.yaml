      Neuvillette's Burst is a small portion of his total damage, so this
      Constellation doesn't increase his damage much.

      > *When using Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment, Neuvillette can absorb
      nearby Sourcewater Droplets in an AoE. Each absorbed Droplet will increase
      the duration of Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment by 1s.

      > Additionally, when Equitable Judgment hits opponents, it will fire off 2
      additional currents every 2s, each of which will deal 10% of Neuvillette's
      Max HP as Hydro DMG. DMG dealt this way will count as DMG dealt by
      Equitable Judgment.*


      With C6, if a Charged Attack nears the end of its duration and there are
      available Sourcewater Droplets nearby, Neuvillette will absorb another
      Droplet to extend the Charged Attack’s duration by 1s. 


      The damage improvements from this Constellation can be difficult to
      evaluate due to how it intrinsically changes his rotations, ranging from a
      minimum of 15% to well over 36% improvement over C5. However, the
      additional currents mean that there will always be an improvement to his
      DPS. His C6 also makes his C4 useful, with the additional Droplets
      extending the duration of his CAs by about 2-3s total — equivalent to an
      entire standard Charged Attack.


      While the changes in his rotation can cause extensions or worsen buff
      uptime. Neuvillete does so much damage at C6 that its boosts are almost
      always worth capitalizing on.

      However, this means that C6's value also depends on what team Neuvillette
      is in: teams featuring short skill/buff durations (such as Kazuha teams)
      will be worse off than those featuring long off-field skill/buff durations
      (such as Raiden and Nahida in Hyperbloom).
