      <:sands:1094559345364185119> *Sands of Eon:* HP%

      <:goblet:1094559512968581130> *Goblet of Eonothem:* Hydro DMG% / HP%

      <:circlet:1094559608581922966> *Circlet of Logos:* CRIT / HP%


      Depending on the weapon and artifact set Neuvillette is using, HP/Hydro
      DMG/CRIT, HP/Hydro DMG/HP, and HP/HP/CRIT are all viable options.

      HP/HP/HP with good enough substats is also an option, but it is notably
      worse in every situation.


      HP/Hydro DMG/CRIT is almost always the best option, but more often than
      not by a very small margin.


      HP/Hydro DMG/HP is always highly competitive with HP/Hydro DMG/CRIT,
      except when Neuvillette is using a non-CRIT weapon while also not running
      4pc Marechaussee Hunter.


      HP/HP/CRIT is competitive only when Neuvillette is using a weapon that
      provides significantly more CRIT and/or DMG% than HP% e.g. Rite of the
      Eternal Flow or Blackcliff Agate.


      **Substats:** ER until requirement > CRIT DMG = CRIT Rate = HP% > Flat HP
