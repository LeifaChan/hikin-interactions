      C3 increases the levels of Neuvi's most important Talent. A decent damage
      increase.

      Neuvillette already has enough Sourcewater Droplets in his rotations at
      C0, so this Constellation is useless—at least until C6. Therefore, don't
      pull C4 unless you're planning on going to C6.
