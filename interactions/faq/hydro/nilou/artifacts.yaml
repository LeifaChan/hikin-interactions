      **Artifact Main Stats**

      *Sands:* HP% > ER% 

      *Goblet:* HP%

      *Circlet:* HP%

      *Substats:* ER (until requirements) > HP% > HP = EM

      Generally, Nilou will want to use either triple HP% main stat gear (when
      bursting every second rotation), or ER/HP/HP gear with enough ER% substats
      to reach 180% (when bursting every rotation). Both combinations are
      generally equivalent to each other as long as the extra Hydro application
      from using the Burst off cooldown doesn’t help you get more Blooms for
      your team. Focusing on HP% gear makes Nilou very easy to farm for and to
      build (as you don’t worry about crit) and gives her the highest possible
      team-wide boost to Bloom damage through her A4 passive.

      Crit DPS builds are possible and viable, and dare I say, ***fun***, but
      are not recommended, and will generally perform worse than HP% focused
      builds.

      __Artifact Sets__

      2PC Tenacity of the Millelith and 2PC EM/HydroDMG%/BurstDMG%
    description: Nilou’s Artifact set options are fairly flexible. In general the best option is  2-PC Tenacity of the Milleleth for the 20 HP%, with any of the following 2-sets 2-PC Gilded Dreams, 2-PC Heart of Depth, 2-PC Noblesse, with 2-PC Heart of Depth/2-PC Gilded Dreams also performing well as a combo. Just use whichever combo of these 2 piece sets gives better substats, prioritizing HP%, ER% (if bursting every rotation) and EM.


      Note that for Sword Stance, where Nilou is on field, 2-PC Tenacity of the
      Milleleth/2-PC Heart of Depth will start to outperform other 2-PC
      combinations.

  - title: 4PC Deepwood Memories
    description: You may also consider using 4-PC Deepwood Memories on Nilou in the event
      that your other teammates have more optimal sets that they would rather
      run, as the Dendro RES Shred is very important for Nilou’s teams due to
      the general focus on Bloom damage. However, this may be unlikely as most
      Dendro units will be able to synergize well with the set better, and will
      be able to maintain the Shred uptime more easily from off field, as
      Nilou’s Whirl stance Tranquility Aura will not refresh the Shred.
