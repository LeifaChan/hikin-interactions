      Your weapons, in some small part, depend on whether or not you are using
      Nilou’s Burst off cooldown (and thus building with Energy Recharge). If
      you ***are*** Bursting off cooldown, Festering Desire, the event weapon
      from 1.2, is a top-tier option just below Nilou’s own signature weapon.
      Favonius Sword also becomes an obvious choice.


      In all other cases, these weapons are your go-to.

      __Signature Weapon__

      Key of Khaj-Nisut 
    description: >-
      Gives lots of HP% and allows
      Nilou to convert her max HP to an EM buff for herself and for the rest of
      the team. Allows Nilou to double dip by getting high EM while building
      full HP%, which both empower her Blooms.

      R5 Sacrificial Sword 
    description: >-
      *Any* hit from Sword stance can reset the skill
      cooldown, which allows Nilou to use Sword stance attacks while her
      Tranquility Aura is active

      Final Thoughts on Weapons
    description:
      Options change orders based on how many Blooms Nilou is able to trigger
      and whether Nilou opts to Burst off cooldown or not. Because of this, a
      clear hierarchy is nearly impossible, but unsurprisingly, her signature
      weapon stays head-and-shoulders above the competition in every possible
      circumstance.
