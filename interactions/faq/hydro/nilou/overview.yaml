  - title: __**DISCLAIMER (This one is especially important)**__
    description: >-
      Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release
      (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
      Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little
      information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally,
      are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ
      should be taken with a grain of salt.

  - title: __**CHARACTER OVERVIEW**__
    description: >-
      Nilou is a Hydro sword-user who can play both DPS and support roles on
      Bloom teams specifically, thanks to her unique Skill that allows for
      varying playstyles. She is hyper specialized for teams utilizing the Bloom
      reaction. The majority of her team benefits depend on her teams consisting
      only of Hydro and Dendro characters, meaning that while fulfilling her
      designed role, she cannot benefit from other types of reactions. Aside
      from this, her Hydro application is consistent and/or rapid, depending on
      what “stance” she takes with her Skill.


      In most cases where Nilou may want to use her Burst off cooldown, Nilou
      needs 180% Energy Recharge. ***Players who pick up Nilou do not need to
      prioritize using her Burst off-cooldown*** unless the  equipment she
      carries depends on its use, or if the extra Hydro application helps her
      team produce more Blooms per rotation. The damage in the end is usually
      comparable or better when forsaking Energy Recharge altogether.


      Nilou cares ***exclusively*** about three stats: HP, Elemental Mastery,
      and sometimes Energy Recharge. This trivializes many weapons that only
      grant ATK bonuses, since Nilou’s talents scale purely off HP. Bloom
      reactions scale purely with Elemental Mastery, and ATK is not needed there
      either.


      That said, Nilou has exactly one use case: Bloom teams. While she can play
      any role on these teams, and she is the undisputed best character for
      these teams with her incredibly efficient passive talents, this means that
      often Nilou will require other limited 5-star characters or
      high-constellation 4-stars to function. In these teams, one can safely and
      conservatively estimate 8 blooms per 20-second rotation, but can reach
      upwards of 10 Blooms with the current options for Dendro supports. The
      greatest challenge to piloting Nilou in-practice will be controlling the
      ownership of Bloom reactions so the character with the greatest Elemental
      Mastery gets to deal the damage.


      Nilou’s greatest weakness, even beyond that, is that her ideal teammates
      are not currently available in-game. A Dendro healer, or a unit with
      faster Dendro application (whether off-field or on-field) would greatly
      enhance Nilou teams’ potential.
