      **Bloom Teams**


      Bloom teams focus more on making as many Blooms as possible, since one
      Bloom will automatically detonate when there are more than five on the
      field. Otherwise, Dendro Cores take about five seconds to occur without
      elemental interference, dealing damage to everyone caught in the blast
      (you only take a very small fraction of this).


      Nilou’s passive allows Blooms to explode almost immediately, deal more
      damage, and expand the range of Bloom explosions. She is a must-have for
      Bloom teams that can afford to commit to her, but cannot compete in other
      roles in other types of teams.

      There are three options for team structures: 


      Double Resonance (2 Hydro 2 Dendro) is the most chaotic when trying to
      control Bloom ownership unless you run a character with very minimal Hydro
      application like Barbara. If you struggle controlling Bloom ownership, the
      power of teamwide EM buffs like Instructor and Elegy for the End increase.
      In these teams, consider building EM on units that do not have high
      personal damage with standard DPS builds (for example DMC), but running
      standard DPS builds on units that do have decent personal damage (such
      Ocean-Hued-Clam Kokomi or Yelan). Nilou can still more than double the
      Bloom damage of teammates that build low to no EM, even with F2P builds.


      Your double resonance team will basically be restricted to **Nilou, Dendro
      Traveler, Collei, and Kokomi or Barbara.** A healer is (basically)
      mandatory, since Blooms also eat away at your characters’ health. Sadly
      the only options for healers are a limited 5-star and… well, Barbara, who
      also can’t generate energy for the team. A dendro healer is sorely needed,
      but does not exist in the current game state. Unfortunately, Prototype
      Amber or Xingqiu rain sword heals are not enough to heal through teamwide
      Bloom damage, especially in multitarget scenarios.


      Triple Hydro teams focus on rapid Hydro application in order to ensure a
      Dendro character building full EM takes full ownership of Bloom reactions.
      The Yelan + Xingqiu off-field DPS combo can certainly carry nearly any
      combination of other characters, so the last piece of the team is a Dendro
      unit with healing. 


      Lastly, when another Dendro character is released, Triple Dendro can
      ensure Nilou has full ownership of the Blooms she buffs. However,
      sacrificing the new Hydro resonance HP boost is a huge detriment, so the
      bar for Dendro performance must be high enough to compensate.
