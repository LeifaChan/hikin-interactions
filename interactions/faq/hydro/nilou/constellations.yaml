      Gives Nilou 6 more seconds of Tranquility Aura uptime in Whirl stance, or
      65% DMG bonus to the last chain of Nilou’s auto attack string in Sword
      Stance. Specifically, if the 3 more instances of Hydro application result
      in Nilou triggering 3 more blooms owned by her (which is unlikely with
      current Dendro supports),  then this constellation can add around 40% more
      damage to Nilou in single target scenarios, and possibly twice as much
      more damage against 2 targets, and the value of this constellation may be
      slightly less if your team can already generate a higher number of blooms
      than our somewhat conservative assumption. However for sword stance this
      constellation only adds around 7% more damage due her raw Hydro damage
      being less significant compared to her Blooms. Rating: 4/5 if you can get
      3 more blooms per rotation, 1/5 if no extra blooms can be produced, and
      2/5 for Sword Stance.

      Provides 35% RES Shred for both Hydro and Dendro DMG for the entire team.
      This constellation is a solid increase by virtue of increasing team-wide
      Bloom damage alone, and may become more 

      valuable in the future if Nilou can run Dendro and Hydro teammates with
      higher personal damage contributions outside of Bloom.

      Increased multipliers for her Elemental Burst do very little for Nilou
      overall. Rating: 1/5.

      Makes Nilou’s Elemental Skill grant her 15 energy, and 50% Elemental Burst
      DMG bonus if used within 8 seconds of her Elemental Skill. Given the
      supportive nature of Nilou’s kit, this constellation sounds like it
      doesn’t do much, but it is actually relatively impactful because it lowers
      Nilou’s ER% requirements to around 140% when bursting every rotation. This
      allows you to drop ER% sands when bursting every rotation and run HP%
      sands instead with a few more ER% subs, which results in a significant
      gain alongside the Elemental Burst DMG bonus.

      Nilou gains multipliers for her Elemental Skill. This does very little for
      Whirl Stance but is a small boost to Sword Stance.

      Gives Nilou .6% Crit Rate % and 1.2% Crit Damage % for every 1000 HP she
      has to a cap of 30% and 60% respectively. With 50,000 HP, Nilou can easily
      hit this cap. This constellation is quite powerful and allows Nilou to be
      able to attain a decent Crit Ratio without compromising the HP% she needs
      to amplify team-wide Bloom damage, and truly takes her personal damage to
      the next level, though its effects are less impactful for Whirl Stance. It
      may open up the viability of more Crit focused builds, but this will have
      to be explored upon release.
