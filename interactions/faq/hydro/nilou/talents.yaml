      **Analysis:**


      It is highly recommended to get Nilou to level 90 to boost her base HP
      pool as high as possible, as well as to enable her Blooms to have the
      highest possible level scaling for base damage.


      Nilou lives and dies by her Skill, as the Burst can be neglected entirely
      and her Normal Attacks are the only talents that use her ATK stat.


      When using Nilou’s skill, she can then do a 3-hit combo in any combination
      of Normal Attack and Skill button presses, all dealing Hydro damage based
      on Max HP. Depending on whether you use a Normal Attack (changed to
      “Swords Dance”) or Skill (changed to “Whirling Steps”), Nilou enters one
      of two stances she can take, “Luminous Illusion” (Normal Attack) and
      “Water Wheel” (Skill).


      Luminous Illusion continuously converts her Normal Attacks to Swords Dance
      moves for 8 seconds. This is Nilou’s DPS stance, and should be used when
      you want her to spend as much time on-field as possible. 


      Water Wheel creates a ring around the active character that continuously
      applies Wet to enemies. The ICD on her Wheel is 2 seconds, but will tick
      every half-second checking for new enemies to affect. This is Nilou’s
      support stance, and although it doesn’t deal damage, it allows her to
      apply Hydro from off-field.


      Nilou’s Burst is simply a modest instance of Hydro damage based on Max HP
      that marks enemies affected. These marked enemies will then suffer a
      second delayed hit of comparable strength. There are no other effects for
      this talent. The Elemental Burst should be used if you need two more
      applications of Hydro to generate more Blooms for your team.


      Nilou’s passive talents depend on the team consisting only of Hydro and
      Dendro characters, with at least one of each of the two elements. These
      passives buff Bloom damage for the whole team by up to 400% based on
      Nilou’s Max HP, and can give Nilou and her teammates 100 EM to further
      boost Bloom damage. Blooms will become “Bountiful Cores”. which also
      explode almost immediately upon creation and damage enemies in a greater
      AoE range. The radius of the AoE hitbox of the Bountiful Cores is slightly
      bigger than the radius of Kokomi’s Jellyfish, which can damage groups of
      enemies without the need for significant grouping. The HP scaling boost to
      Bloom damage and her signature elemental reaction is the Crux of Nilou’s
      kit and enables Bloom to function as the main source of damage for Nilou’s
      teams.
