      *CD: **20s***


      Furina’s Elemental Skill summons the Salon Solitaire to aid the team in
      battle. She will summon either the Salon Members or the Singers of Many
      Waters, based on her current Arkhe alignment. It has a long duration of 30
      seconds and a cooldown of 20 seconds, allowing for 100% uptime, even in
      teams with longer rotations, such as Neuvillette teams.


      When aligned with Ousia, Furina will summon three Salon Members, who will
      each attack enemies at different intervals (prioritizing the target of the
      active character), dealing Hydro DMG based on Furina’s Max HP. If there
      are party members with more than 50% HP, they will drain their HP upon
      attacking, while also increasing the damage of the Salon Members by
      110%/120%/130%/140%, based on the number of characters who had their HP
      consumed. Each Salon Member deals a different amount of damage and drains
      a different amount of HP from all teammates upon attacking. Furina’s Salon
      Members will drain around 2.5% HP per second from all of her teammates,
      making healers a requirement when playing her in order to maximize her
      damage, as characters at/below 50% HP won’t have sufficient HP available
      to drain to acquire the damage increase for her Salon Members.


      When aligned with Pneuma, Furina will summon the Singers of Many Waters,
      who will heal nearby active characters based on her Max HP. While this
      means that she will provide AoE healing in co-op, in singleplayer, only
      the current active character will be healed, meaning that she won’t be
      able to reliably solo-sustain the whole team against her own HP draining
      mechanics.


      The currently active Salon Solitaire guests can be swapped at will by
      using her Charged Attack to change her Arkhe alignment, meaning players
      can easily swap from damage to healing if their HP gets too low. However,
      since both guests can’t be active at the same time, she will lose out on
      generating Energy and applying Hydro whilst the Singers of Many Waters are
      active.


      Currently, Furina’s Elemental Skill DOES NOT snapshot, meaning that any
      buffs she currently has will affect her guest’s damage or healing
      dynamically throughout their duration.
