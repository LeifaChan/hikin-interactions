  - title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
    description: >-
      Due to Furina’s wide variety of teams, her Energy requirements can vary
      drastically. In scenarios with few Hydro particles, her Energy
      requirements can reach well above 200%, compared to scenarios with an
      abundance of Hydro particles going as low as 130%. Neuvillette teams also
      have relatively low Energy requirements due to the longer rotation length,
      allowing for 2 uses of Neuvillette’s Skill. 


      Furina’s Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation.
