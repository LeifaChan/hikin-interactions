      **Splendor of Tranquil Waters**
    description: >-
      Her signature weapon and current best in slot option, providing a large
      amount of CRIT DMG from its substat, as well as both Skill DMG Bonus and
      HP% when the user and teammates’ current HP changes respectively. Although
      this is a standout weapon on her, it is currently not an improvement by a
      huge margin compared to even F2P weapons, so players may wish to hold off
      on wishing for this compared to her Constellations.

    description: >-
      Another 5-star option that performs well on Furina, granting a large
      amount of CRIT Rate, as well as HP% from its Passive. Furina will almost
      always prefer to run a CRIT DMG circlet when using this weapon, due to her
      also having CRIT Rate as her ascension stat. Despite this, it's her next
      best option at lower ER requirements for personal damage.

  - title: '**Key of Khaj-Nisut**'
    description: >-
      The Key grants Furina more supportive abilities, giving a teamwide EM buff
      upon hitting enemies with her Skill, which scales off of her Max HP. It
      also provides a massive amount of HP%, perfect for increasing the amount
      of EM she provides, as well as easily letting her run an Energy Recharge
      sands without much downside in scenarios with high ER requirements.
      Although she already gets a lot of DMG% from other sources, Hydro DMG
      goblets gain in value due to the large amounts of HP she has when running
      this weapon.
