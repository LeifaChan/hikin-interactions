      __TALENT PRIORITY__

      **Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst > Normal Attack**
    description: >-
      ## __Analysis__

      - Furina’s Elemental Skill is her main source of damage, whilst her
      Elemental Burst provides large amounts of DMG Bonus and Incoming Healing
      Bonus. Because of this, players will want to level both talents equally.
      Her Normal Attack talents can be ignored, unless players are using her
      on-field at C6, in which case her Normal Attack talent levels become
      slightly less negligible.

      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Soloist's Solicitation**
    description: >-
      Furina performs a 4-hit attack string. At C0, she has almost no reason to
      use these. However, at C6, she gains a Hydro Infusion and increased
      scalings based on her Max HP. Her Charged Attack may be used often to
      change her Arkhe alignment between Ousia and Pneuma, changing the effects
      of her Elemental Skill and helping with overworld puzzles. Both Arkhe
      Attacks have a 6s CD each, making her excel at any content involving Arkhe
      mechanics compared to previous Fontainian characters.
