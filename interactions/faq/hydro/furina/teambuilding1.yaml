  - title: __TEAM BUILDING__
    description: >-
      Furina’s main condition requires either a healer or teammate with large
      amounts of HP manipulation in order to get a decent amount of Fanfare
      every rotation. Because of this, the best suited roles for the job are AoE
      healers and current Fontainian DPS. If players can fulfill these
      conditions, she can be run with almost any other characters, due to
      providing both large amounts of off-field damage and buffing. 

      Due to her wide variety of teams, some standout teammates will be listed
      rather than set archetypes, whilst also providing a few sample teams
      instead of an exhaustive list. For more info on a specific character,
      please check out their respective FAQs or KQM Guides.

  - title: __**Fontainian Teammates**__
    description: >-
      Most Fontainian characters have access to HP manipulation, helping to
      speed up Fanfare gain for the team. Although our current roster is slim,
      future characters with these mechanics will fit with her very similarly.

  - title: '**Neuvillette**'
    description: >-
      Neuvillette is able to gain large amounts of Fanfare due to him both
      draining and healing constantly between 60% and 100% HP when using his
      Charged Attacks. His HP manipulation is so great, he can be played without
      a healer and still get a good amount of Fanfare, allowing for more
      offensive teammates to be used, at the cost of Furina’s personal damage.
      Neuvillette also greatly benefits from his Constellation 1 when being run
      with Furina, granting him an extra stack for his A1 Passive and 100%
      Interruption Resistance, further amplifying the offensive pressure of his
      teams. Neuvillette also tends to overcap his HP when healing from a
      Charged Attack, activating Furina’s A1 Passive to provide extra healing to
      the party.

  - title: '**Wriothesley**'
    description: >-
      Wriothesley also drains large amounts of his HP when he attacks during the
      Chilling Penalty state, further increasing Fanfare gain for the team.
      However, his total HP loss is further increased when paired with Furina,
      making a healer a requirement in order to keep Wriothesley above 50% HP to
      avoid disabling the Chilling Penalty state. This large amount of HP drain
      further incentivises healers, who will now change more amounts of HP,
      resulting in more Fanfare gained. Although Wriothesley’s C1 increases his
      survivability, it is still recommended to run him with a healer due to the
      extra Fanfare gained whilst keeping his off-field teammates healthy.
