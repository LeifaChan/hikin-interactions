    description: >-
      An outstanding F2P option for Furina, providing a mix of utility and
      offense with its ER% substat, Skill CRIT Rate, and DMG Bonus Passive. This
      weapon provides almost everything Furina needs to shine, competing with
      Jade Cutter for her 2nd best option in higher ER scenarios. However, this
      weapon was only available back in 1.2, meaning many players may not have
      it. Regardless, for those who do, it is an amazing choice.

  - title: '**Fleuve Cendre Ferryman**'
    description: >-
      Another F2P sword for helping Furina’s ER requirements, whilst also
      providing extra Skill CRIT Rate and a variable Energy Recharge buff after
      using an Elemental Skill. Due to Furina generating Particles over the
      course of a rotation, this extra ER isn’t too useful, unless players can
      funnel a large amount of Particles into her quickly from another Hydro
      teammate. On the other hand, it is free from Fontaine’s Fishing
      Association, meaning players can slowly farm for it and its refinements
      over time.

  - title: '**Favonius Sword**'
    description: >-
      In scenarios with high ER requirements, Favonius soars up the ranks
      compared to other options, granting large amounts of Energy Recharge and
      even more Energy to the party through its Passive. Although it moderately
      reduces her damage potential when compared to other weapons, it’s a good
      option to consider if she needs a lot of Energy for the team you’d like to
      play her in.
