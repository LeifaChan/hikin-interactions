      Although Furina’s Energy requirements may be high, she can actually be an
      increase to Eula teams, given you can gain a large amount of Fanfare. Mika
      works excellently for this role, providing a large AoE heal and then
      extra, off-field healing to the active character, which helps to trigger
      Furina’s A1 Passive consistently. With constellations, he becomes on par
      or better than Bennett in terms of buffs for Eula, whilst Fischl helps to
      trigger Superconduct and provide extra Energy to the team. Raiden can be a
      viable option over Fischl for double carry teams, where she is able to
      catch the tail end of Furina’s Fanfare on most of her Burst and further
      lower Energy requirements.

      Another general Raiden team containing the sunfire duo of Jean and
      Bennett, helping to both buff, heal and apply large amounts of Pyro for
      the team. Jean’s Burst helps to gain a lot of Fanfare very quickly whilst
      consistently activating Furinas A1 Passive for even more healing. The
      extreme Pyro application also allows for many Overloaded and Vaporize
      reactions to be triggered, however, the lack of grouping may not be for
      everyone.

      One of the few teams that can safely run a single-target healer. Due to
      the team having no dedicated on-field character, players can swap freely
      between their party members when they need healing, and then swap back to
      Bennett to repeatedly use his Skill to funnel Particles into Xiangling.
      Yelan is able to freely use her Skill twice per rotation in this team,
      helping to lower Furina’s Energy Requirements further. Xingqiu can be a
      viable alternative with higher Energy Requirements in exchange for
      defensive utility and Hydro RES Shred from his Constellation 2.

      An alternative style of Nilou Bloom that doesn’t require Nahida, instead
      preferring to use Alhaitham on-field whilst Furina provides both Hydro
      application and off-field damage. Nilou’s Tranquility Aura provides
      additional Hydro application for Bountiful Blooms and Baizhu provides
      large amounts of healing to generate Fanfare and to help offset the team’s
      self damage. Baizhu can also run Prototype Amber for additional healing
      and Energy whilst having the freedom to use two Skills quite safely.
      Furina’s Fanfare buff is utilized effectively by Alhaitham, providing
      large amounts of Dendro DMG and application for Blooms. Although Baizhu’s
      shields will help mitigate it somewhat, this team is adding Furina’s
      teamwide HP drain on top of the Bountiful Bloom’s self damage, which may
      be uncomfortable for some players.
