  - title: '**Hu Tao / Furina / Hydro / Jean**'
    description: >-
      ER Reqs: 210%


      This team replaces either Xingqiu or Yelan for Furina, playing similarly
      to original Hu Tao double Hydro teams. Although Hu Tao has innate HP loss
      mechanics, she gains an extra 33% Pyro DMG Bonus whilst under 50% HP from
      her A4 Passive. This is counteractive with Furina’s HP drain, requiring
      teammates to be above 50% HP in order to have their HP drained. On top of
      this, Hu Tao teams generally don’t run a healer because of her A4 Passive,
      making the 4th slot now a requirement to be a healer to keep Furina’s
      extra Skill damage active and Fanfare stacking up. Like other teams with
      burst healers, they can frontload a large amount of Fanfare from the 2nd
      rotation onwards, overcoming the loss of Hu Tao’s A4 Passive whilst
      buffing the rest of the team at the same time. However, the Energy
      requirements in this team are quite high, so don’t hesitate to run
      Favonius weapons if need be.

  - title: '**Cyno / Furina / Nahida / Baizhu**'
    description: >-
      ER Reqs: 175%


      Another team that replaces Xingqiu or Yelan for Furina to provide Cyno
      with large amounts of DMG Bonus, alongside Furina’s high personal damage.
      Although Cyno has access to weapons such as the Kitain Cross Spear, the
      Energy requirements for this team can be very high without extra help from
      weapons like Favonius. Baizhu can also carry Prototype Amber to help with
      his own Energy requirements and provide some extra immediate Fanfare upon
      using his Elemental Burst.

  - title: '**Ayaka / Furina / Shenhe / Charlotte**'
    description: >-
      ER Reqs: 205%


      Due to Furina’s Salon Members attacking as they wish, she can be a great
      slot in for Freeze teams, granting even more buffs to Ayaka to further
      boost the benefit added from Shenhe’s Icy Quill effect. Charlotte can also
      wield the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers to provide Ayaka with a large
      amount of ATK%, whilst providing a lot of immediate Fanfare. If players
      require additional grouping, Shenhe can be replaced for an Anemo
      character, such as Kazuha. However, this team will still perform strong
      against unfreezable enemies due to the raw damage output from Ayaka.
