      **Ascension 1 Passive: Endless Waltz**
    description: >-
      If the currently active character is overhealed by someone that isn’t
      Furina, Furina will heal all nearby party members for 2% of their Max HP
      once every 2 seconds within the next 4 seconds. This Passive will help to
      gain some extra Fanfare for her Burst, and, if activated frequently, acts
      like a pseudo Prototype Amber.

  - title: '**Ascension 4 Passive: Unheard Confession**'
    description: >-
      Furina will grant buffs to her Salon Solitaire guests based on her Max HP.
      For every 1,000 points of HP she has, the Salon Members will gain 0.7% DMG
      Bonus, up to a maximum of 28%, and the healing interval of the Singers of
      Many Waters will be decreased by 0.4%, up to a maximum of 16%. These
      effects will be maxed out at 40,000 HP, meaning players may want to run a
      secondary HP main stat piece to help reach this.
