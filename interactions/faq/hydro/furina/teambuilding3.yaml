  - title: __**Burst Healers**__
    description: >-
      Burst healers specialize in providing a large, immediate amount of healing
      to the entire team. This can help with gaining a large amount of Fanfare
      immediately once Furina has already drained your team’s HP. Characters
      that fall into this category include: Jean, Baizhu, Barbara, Sayu, Yaoyao,
      Mika and Charlotte.

  - title: '**Baizhu**'
    description: >-
      Compared to our other burst healers, Baizhu doesn’t need to use his
      Elemental Burst to heal the entire team, instead only needing to cast his
      Skill, which can be used once every 10 seconds. He also provides extra
      comfort through his Burst, periodically healing the active character
      whilst refreshing his shields and applying Dendro to the enemy. This
      periodic healing helps to consistently activate Furina’s A1 Passive,
      keeping the team even healthier and generating more Fanfare.

  - title: '**Jean**'
    description: >-
      Jean is a great slot in for teams that need to consolidate both 4pc
      Viridescent Venerer and healing. Her Burst not only provides extra
      continuous healing to characters inside her Field, but also cleanses,
      Swirling the element cleansed onto nearby enemies. Her A4 Passive also
      helps to lower her Energy requirements, alongside a low cooldown Skill to
      refresh 4pc VV if needed.

  - title: '**Charlotte**'
    description: >-
      A new 4-star Cryo Catalyst healer who will be available on Furina’s
      banner. Although her Energy requirements can be very high, she can make
      great use of Prototype Amber despite her healing scaling off her ATK. Her
      healing is already high at C0, but when factoring in both Constellations
      and Prototype Amber, her total healing skyrockets to the point of needing
      no extra healing substats to sustain the team. This allows her to focus
      fully on the Energy Recharge she needs to consistently cast her Elemental
      Burst.

  - title: '**Mika**'
    description: >-
      A 4-star Cryo Polearm healer with both a strong AoE Burst heal and
      sustained single-target healing. Compared to Charlotte, Mika has access to
      the new Fontaine craftable polearm, Rightful Reward, granting him HP% and
      large amounts of Energy when he receives healing. In a Furina team, he is
      able to trigger this passive twice, thanks to Furinas A1 Passive, allowing
      him to run next to no Energy Recharge in his teams. He also provides an
      Attack Speed and Physical DMG Bonus buff, allowing him to fit nicely into
      Wriothesley, Wanderer and Eula teams, alongside Furina for even more team
      buffs.

  - title: '**Prototype Amber**'
    description: >-
      Prototype Amber at R5 provides healing to all party members equal to 18%
      of their Max HP. which can be used for extra comfort, and more immediate
      Fanfare gain in teams. Alongside Furina’s Fanfare, and a Healing Bonus
      Circlet, this can be increased to ~30% Max HP or ~36% Max HP with 4pc
      Maiden Beloved. Although this generally won’t sustain a team by itself, it
      can make teams with single-target healing much easier to play, especially
      if your Catalyst teammate doesn’t require any other gear to benefit the
      team. In longer rotations, characters with lower cost Elemental Bursts
      such as Ninggaung or Heizou can activate Prototype Amber’s Passive twice
      to heal 60% of the party’s Max HP. They are also able to run supportive
      artifact sets such as 4pc Archaic Petra or Viridescent Venerer with little
      to no Energy Recharge substats due to the large amounts of Energy granted
      by this weapon.
