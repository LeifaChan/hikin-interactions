          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions.

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Furina is a 5-star Hydro Sword character whose kit revolves around
      summoning the guests of the Salon Solitaire to deal damage and manipulate
      the team’s HP. Her Charged Attack can be used to change her Arkhe
      alignment between Ousia and Pneuma, changing the effects her guests
      provide. Her Elemental Burst causes the team to enter the Universal
      Revelry state, increasing their DMG Bonus and Incoming Healing Bonus based
      on how much their current HP changes during its duration.


      Furina will primarily be played off-field, dealing significant damage with
      minimal field time, whilst providing substantial buffs to the team.
      Because of this, she can fit into a large variety of teams. However,
      players may want to invest in characters that provide large amounts of
      healing, such as Baizhu or Kokomi, in order to offset Furina’s HP drains
      and increase the amount of Fanfare stacks gained during her Burst state.
