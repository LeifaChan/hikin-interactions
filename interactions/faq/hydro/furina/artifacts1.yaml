      Depending on Furina’s weapon, artifact set, and the team she’s in,
      HP/HP/CRIT, and HP/Hydro DMG/CRIT perform very similarly to each other.
      Generally, accounting for Fanfare and team buffs, HP/HP/CRIT will perform
      better, but the difference is not substantial. In some scenarios, Furina
      may need to run an Energy Recharge Sands, due to her high Energy
      requirements. In these scenarios, a HP Goblet will be much more beneficial
      compared to a DMG Bonus one for most builds.


      **Substats:** ER until requirement > CRIT DMG = CRIT Rate = HP% > Flat HP
