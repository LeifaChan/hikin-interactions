      *CD: **15s***

      *Energy Cost: **60***


      Furina’s Elemental Burst deals AoE Hydro DMG and causes all party members
      to enter the Universal Revelry state. During this state, when nearby party
      members’ HP changes, they will grant Furina one Fanfare for each
      percentage point that their Max HP changed (For example, a 40% reduction
      in a nearby character’s HP would grant Furina 40 Fanfare). Based on the
      amount of Fanfare Furina has (up to a maximum of 300 Fanfare), she will
      grant all nearby party members DMG Bonus and Incoming Healing Bonus. At
      max Fanfare, Furina is granting the team 69% DMG Bonus and 27% Incoming
      Healing Bonus, a large amount of stats that almost no character would hate
      to have. Fanfare is based on the percentage of HP changed, meaning that
      teams with AoE healers such as on-field Kokomi, Jean, or Baizhu, or
      characters with fast HP manipulation, such as Neuvillette and Wriothesley,
      will gain Fanfare much quicker than teams with single-target healers. Due
      to Fanfare being a stacking effect, gaining Fanfare earlier in a rotation
      is going to be much more impactful than near the end. Her Elemental Burst
      can have 100% uptime in some teams, being a 60 cost Burst with an 18
      second duration and a 15 second cooldown. Once the duration of her Burst
      ends or is recast, all Fanfare points will be cleared.
