      **Constellation 1 - "Love Is a Rebellious Bird That None Can Tame"**
    description: >-
      > *When using Let the People Rejoice, Furina will gain 150 Fanfare.

      > Additionally, Furina's Fanfare limit is increased by 100.*


      Immediately grants 34.5% DMG Bonus and 13.5% Incoming Healing Bonus to the
      whole team upon casting Furina’s Burst, helping to gain even more
      frontloaded Fanfare. It also raises the maximum amount of Fanfare that
      Furina can obtain, increasing the max buffs to 92% DMG Bonus and 36%
      Incoming Healing Bonus at Talent level 9, making it an amazing
      Constellation for any team she’s used in. The personal gain of this
      Constellation is representative of its value for the whole team.

  - title: '**Constellation 2 - "A Woman Adapts Like Duckweed in Water"**'
    description: >-
      > *While Let the People Rejoice lasts, Furina's Fanfare gain from
      increases or decreases in nearby characters' HP is increased by 250%. Each
      point of Fanfare above the limit will increase Furina's Max HP by 0.35%.
      Her maximum Max HP increase is 140%.*


      Another amazing Constellation for any Furina team. C2 increases her
      Fanfare gain by 3.5x, allowing her to rapidly gain and cap Fanfare.
      Additionally, Furina converts any overcapped Fanfare into large amounts of
      HP% for herself, massively increasing her personal damage output.
