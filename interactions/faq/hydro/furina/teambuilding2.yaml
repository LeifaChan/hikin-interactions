  - title: __**Non-Fontanian Teammates**__
    description: >-
      Currently, Furina’s standout non-Fontanian teammates are ones who
      specialize in AoE healing. These come in two categories: sustained
      healers, who will slowly heal the entire team over time, and burst
      healers, who grant a large amount of healing to the entire team
      immediately.

  - title: __****Sustained Healers****__
    description: >-
      Sustained healers specialize in consistently healing the team over the
      course of a rotation. This provides less frontloaded stacks compared to
      burst healing, but comes with the added benefit of keeping teammates
      consistently healthy, never letting them get close to the cut off of 50%
      HP. This also comes with the benefit of consistently activating Furina’s
      A1 Passive, which helps to keep the team at high amounts of HP. Currently,
      our only sustained healers require to be on-field to do their job, which
      can limit the options available for teams. Characters that fall into this
      category include: Qiqi, Kokomi, Noelle, Barbara, Dori and Yaoyao.

  - title: '**Kokomi**'
    description: >-
      Kokomi is a perfect candidate for an on-field healer for Furina, providing
      more than enough healing to keep the team healthy whilst helping to lower
      Furina’s Energy requirements. One standout team with her is Mono Hydro, a
      team with very low Energy requirements that makes great use of Furina’s
      Fanfare buff. Unfortunately, the Incoming Healing Bonus provided by
      Furina’s Burst does not interact with Kokomi’s A4 Passive, but the DMG
      Bonus gained is still a large increase for her. Mono Hydro is not Kokomi’s
      only team however, as she’s able to run other playstyles (such as Taser
      and Hyperbloom) with ease.

  - title: '**Noelle**'
    description: >-
      Noelle also fits the role for an on-field healer, providing both healing
      and shielding to the team with the ability to switch off-field if needs
      be, allowing other teammates to use their Skills without losing Noelle’s
      Burst effect. Being a Geo character, Noelle is able to hold 4pc Archaic
      Petra to further increase the damage of her off-field teammates. This set
      also incentivises running more Hydro characters alongside Furina, as they
      can not only take advantage of the buffs provided by Petra, but also help
      to lower Furina’s Energy requirements. To further help with the team’s
      Energy, Noelle can wield the Favonius Greatsword, helping to gain her own
      Burst back due to not generating Particles with her Elemental Skill.
