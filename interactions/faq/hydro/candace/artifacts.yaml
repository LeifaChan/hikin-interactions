    **Sands:** HP% / ER% / ATK% (for On-field)
    **Goblet:** Hydro DMG% > HP
    **Circlet:** CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG > HP%

    **Substats:** ER (until requirements) > CR = CD > HP% > ATK%

    An ER% Sands is always preferred if ER requirements are not met; otherwise, HP% Sands can be used for more personal damage when playing off-field DPS, or ATK% Sands for on-field DPS.
    HP% Goblet and Circlet can be used if you need more NA DMG% buff, but Hydro DMG% Goblet can be used and CRIT Circlet help Candace deals more damage.

- title: 4PC Instructor
  description: This set drastically buffs reaction-based team compositions. However, 4-star artifacts suffer from fewer stats overall, sacrificing some damage and making it harder to reach ER requirements.
