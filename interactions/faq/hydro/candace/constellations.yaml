    C1 - Returning Heiress of the Scarlet Sands
  description: |-
    *The duration of Prayer of the Crimson Crown effect triggered by Sacred Rite: Wagtail's Tide is increased by 3s.*

    This Constellation doesn’t directly increase her damage, but increased uptime means more uptime on hydro aura and her buff, allowing for greedier rotations, which is basically always a welcome addition*

- title: C2 - Moon-Piercing Brilliance

  description: |-
    *The duration of Prayer of the Crimson Crown effect triggered by Sacred Rite: Wagtail's Tide is increased by 3s*

    Gives 20% more HP to Candace, which results in ~7% more personal damage and an extra 1% on her NA buff. More stats is more stats, but it’s nothing to write home about.  color: 7184107

- title: C3 - Hunter’s Supplication

  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of Sacred Rite: Wagtail's Tide by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

    Adds an extra 3 levels to her burst. However, this only adds a little damage for a character whose damage by and large does not matter  color: 7184107

- title: C4 - Sentinel Oath

  description: |-
    *Shortens the Hold CD of Sacred Rite: Heron's Sanctum to be the same as that of the Tapping CD.*

    Reduces hold CD to match tap CD so you no longer have rotations ruined by accidental perfect counters. Largely QOL, but a large QOL

- title: C6 - The Overflow

  description: |-
    *When characters (excluding Candace herself) affected by the Prayer of the Crimson Crown caused by Sacred Rite: Wagtail's Tide deal Elemental DMG to opponents using Normal Attacks, an attack wave will be unleashed that deals AoE Hydro DMG equal to 15% of Candace's Max HP. This effect can trigger once every 2.3s and is considered Elemental Burst DMG.*

    C6 is an entire kit, almost doubling her damage while also bringing her up to 9-10 hydro apps over 12s in addition to the normal infusion. This alone makes her damage actually notable, while also making her a very usable hydro aura for characters that can work around her infusion, while also making her a good bloom proccer should we ever get the Dendro app to support it.
