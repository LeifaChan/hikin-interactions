- title: __COMBOS__
  description: "When playing Candace as a support, her combos are extremely straightforward
    with two variations.\n\nTap E, Q  / hold E, Q \n> *You can swap to Q, E when you
    want to funnel Candace’s Skill particles onto another character needed.*\n"When playing Candace as an on-field Hydro DPS, N3D will be her best combo. For her rotation, although her Burst has a 15-second cooldown
    and her tap Skill has a 6-second cooldown, using two tap skills in a 15-second
    rotation can be punishing (before Constellation 4) because of the interactions
    between her Ascension 1 and her Skill’s mechanics. If your tap E gets hit, its
    cooldown will be increased to 9 seconds and can mess up the rotation length. Therefore,
    it is preferable to use Candace in at least a 20-second rotation."
