"Analysis:\n\nCandace’s kit mainly involves around her Burst to enable
    her Hydro infusion, and since she scales almost entirely of HP aside from Normal
    Attacks, leveling her to 90 is recommended to max out her base HP. Keep in mind
    that her damage contribution is not the greatest, therefore investing in other
    important units is advisable here. \n\nHer Normal Attacks do not deal a great
    amount of damage, and it is also the only part of her kit to scale off ATK instead
    of HP, thus diverting her build (except for on-field Candace enthusiast, then
    level her Normal Attack first). \n\nCandace’s skill has two options, tap and hold.
    Both scale with max HP. On tap, she rushes forward and deals Hydro damage, while
    holding her skill blocks the incoming damage with a shield that scales off her
    HP, has a longer cooldown but deals more damage. While holding can inflict more
    damage, it is not recommended since it takes a long time to cast , and the damage
    difference is not worth the time. After Ascension 1, when you get hit while shielding,
    her skill will finish instantly (similar to Yun Jin’s skill) but still has the
    same cooldown as when holding. With her fourth Constellation, her hold cooldown
    is reduced to be the same as her tap cooldown, which allows for more hold skill
    use if get the right timing. \n\nCandace’s burst is her biggest selling point.
    Being the first character that provides Hydro infusion, she enables driver options
    for freeze, vaporize and bloom teams among others. Her Burst, combined with her
    Ascension 4 passive, will buff Elemental Normal Attacks hence also buff the on-field
    driver. When swapping between characters, it creates Wave Impact DMG instances
    that scales off HP, which is her main source of damage when playing as a support.
    \n\nFinally, her overworld passive talent is great for exploring with the 20%
    climbing stamina reduction."
