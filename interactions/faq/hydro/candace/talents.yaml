  - title: Analysis
    description: >-
      Candace’s kit mainly involves around her Burst to enable
      her Hydro infusion, and since she scales almost entirely of HP aside from Normal
      Attacks, leveling her to 90 is recommended to max out her base HP. Keep in mind
      that her damage contribution is not the greatest, therefore investing in other
      important units is advisable here.

  - title: Normal Attacks
    description: >-
      Her Normal Attacks do not deal a great amount of damage, and it is also the only 
      part of her kit to scale off ATK instead of HP, thus diverting her build 
      (except for on-field Candace enthusiast, then level her Normal Attack first).

  - title: Elemental Skill
    description: >-
      Candace’s skill has two options, tap and hold. Both scale with max HP. 
      On tap, she rushes forward and deals Hydro damage, while holding her skill 
      blocks the incoming damage with a shield that scales off her HP, has a longer 
      cooldown but deals more damage. While holding can inflict more damage, it is 
      not recommended since it takes a long time to cast , and the damage difference 
      is not worth the time. After Ascension 1, when you get hit while shielding,
      her skill will finish instantly (similar to Yun Jin’s skill) but still has the
      same cooldown as when holding. With her fourth Constellation, her hold cooldown
      is reduced to be the same as her tap cooldown, which allows for more hold skill
      use if get the right timing.

  - title: Elemental Burst
    description: >-
      Candace’s burst is her biggest selling point. Being the first character that provides Hydro infusion, she enables driver options
      for freeze, vaporize and bloom teams among others. Her Burst, combined with her
      Ascension 4 passive, will buff Elemental Normal Attacks hence also buff the on-field
      driver. When swapping between characters, it creates Wave Impact DMG instances
      that scales off HP, which is her main source of damage when playing as a support.

      Finally, her overworld passive talent is great for exploring with the 20%
      climbing stamina reduction."
