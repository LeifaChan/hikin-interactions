- title: __ER REQUIREMENT__
  description: "In general, Candace needs around 220% Energy Recharge (ER%) **with**
    Favonius Lance to burst every rotation as a solo hydro unit due to her Skillâ€™s
    particle generation being lackluster for her 60-cost Burst, as well as she will
    most likely be off-field after using her Burst, making funneling energy particles
    difficult. Each Favonius weapon passive proc will reduce her Energy Recharge requirement
    by 15% to 20%. In situations where her team comp has another hydro unit, her Energy
    Recharge requirement is significantly reduced to 180% **with** Favonius Lance.
    As always, an Energy Recharge Calculator is recommended to figure out how much
    ER% Candace needs in certain team comps."
