- title: __ER REQUIREMENT__
  description: "Candaceâ€™s Burst is the core of her kit; therefore, Bursting off cooldown is very essential. Her Skill only generates 2 to 3 Hydro particles per Skill use, making her ER requirements very high for a 60 Energy Cost character. However, due to her lack of damage contribution compared to other characters in the team, funneling particles to her is not advisable. If possible, using 2 Skills per Burst is highly recommended to reduce her high ER requirements."
