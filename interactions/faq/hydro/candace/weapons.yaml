  description: Candace
    follows the general trend among recent 60 cost units that dictates that they need
    more ER than 80 cost units, and she follows this quite well. Despite having 2
    / 3 particle gen on her burst, she often requires 230+ ER *and* Favonius Lance
    if no other hydro units are present to alleviate her needs unless you make room
    in your rotation to swap back to let her E a second time. This seriously impacts
    her weapon choices outside of double hydro team setups, and any weapon that does
    not help her with this issue is a non-starter there

- title: Favonius Lance
  description: Favonius Lance is the obvious
    best choice here with a 30.6% ER substat plus a passive that is often worth another
    40-50% on a unit as energy starved as she is.

- title: Engulfing Lightning
  description: Engulfing Lightning is technically
    better with an 85.1% ER stat, but unless your team has all their energy needs
    already met, the extra energy given off Favonius’s passive will likely be more
    relevant than whatever you’d gain

- title: The Catch / Prototype Starglitter.
  description: While The Catch
    does do more damage, it’s also generally wasted on her, so Prototype Starglitter
    will do.

- title: Kitain Cross Spear
  description: Depending on
    team and rotation, its passive can be worth anywhere from 30-60 ER. In most solo
    hydro comps with no additional help, a R5 Kitain Cross Spear is on par with generic
    ER sub weapons, pushing her ER by a multiplicative 25-33%. It is also the best F2P option when Candace is used in a Bloom team where she has high Bloom ownership.
