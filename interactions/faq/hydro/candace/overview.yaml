- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Candace is a Hydro polearm-user who is most comfortable being played as a support. She is the only character at the time of writing who offers a Hydro infusion to melee weapons. Aside from this, she is a character who scales entirely
    with HP, much like Nilou, unless you’re committing to auto-attacks (which is not
    recommended). \n\nUsing Candace’s burst off cooldown is essential, so you must
    have 220% Energy Recharge as a solo Hydro (no Favonius Lance), and 200% if you
    are using Favonius Lance. If you are using Favonius Lance with another Hydro character,
    Candace’s energy requirements are lowered to 180%.\n\nCandace cares about Energy
    Recharge, Crit Rate (at least 30%), HP, Crit Damage,  and sometimes ATK (if on-field
    DPS) or Elemental Mastery (if built for transformative reactions). As far as weapons
    go, you can pick any weapon that has Crit, HP, or Energy Recharge, since all of
    her talents scale off of HP (excluding auto-attacks).\n\nCandace’s constellations
    focus on improving her personal damage, increasing application, and extending
    hydro infusion. Her C6 gives her extra Hydro application and where most of her
    personal damage comes from, assuming she isn’t the one on field. Furthermore,
    Candace’s C1  extends the duration of her Hydro infusion, and 2 will increase
    her max HP by 20% when her Elemental Skill hits an enemy."
