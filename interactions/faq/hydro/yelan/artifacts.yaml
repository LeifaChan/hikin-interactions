      *Sands:* HP% / ER% 

        When using an ER% weapon like Favonius Warbow, an HP% Sands is advised. When using her signature weapon and other non-ER weapons, she’ll need an ER% Sands.

      *Goblet:* Hydro DMG% > HP

        Hydro% beats HP% by about 7% damage, though depending on your team’s buffs on Yelan, there are niche cases where an HP% Goblet is competitive or better.

      *Circlet:* CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG > HP%

        Crit Rate% or Crit Damage%, as usual. Alternatively, HP% is typically within 1-2% of a Crit circlet, unless you are running a double Hydro team with Yelan’s signature weapon; then Crit circlet wins by about 9%.

      For substats, prioritize meeting your ER% requirements first, then Crit%/HP%. Unlike typical characters, the gap between Crit stats and HP% for Yelan is quite small so prioritize substat quantity over the type of substats (Crit vs HP%). When in doubt, use the calculator in the master sheet.
