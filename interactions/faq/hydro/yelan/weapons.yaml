    Thankfully, due to Yelan’s scaling, the ranks for best weapons are both straightforward *and* accessible. In almost all cases, Favonius Warbow is Yelan’s go-to weapon when her energy needs are high. She naturally wants crit rate, benefits enough from the passive and ER% stats to build into her HP% and Crit%, and gives the most bang per buck for a free weapon on a 5-star character. The fact everyone has one already makes this an almost unbeatable option, second only to her ***limited 5-star*** signature weapon.

    At low ER% requirements, ATK stats don’t matter, so whatever gives the best damage bonuses, crit stats, or HP will work best. Focus less on utility and more on pure damage at low ER% requirements.

    description: CRIT stat stick. Since Yelan doesn't scale with ATK, any of these would give similar result. However, Slingshot is only 1-7% less damage than all bows mentioned here.
