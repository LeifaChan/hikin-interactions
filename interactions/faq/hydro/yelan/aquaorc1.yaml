  - title: Aqua Simulacra or C1?
    description: |-

      Typically, C1 Yelan is advised if you are planning on using her as the sole hydro unit on the team. This is because her energy requirements are so high that Favonius Warbow is often a better option than Aqua for DPS.. The damage that you would gain from having lower energy requirements with C1 is significant. Another important detail is having C1 allows her to actually use non-ER% bows without suffering heavy drawbacks. Keep in mind that in rotations where she is using her skill every 10 or so seconds, the value of C1 drops dramatically.

      The lower Yelanâ€™s energy requirements are in a team the better Aqua Simulacra becomes. It should be noted that Aqua also performs very well on other DPS characters. With one notable example being that it is even or slightly stronger (2%) than amos bow for Ganyu.
