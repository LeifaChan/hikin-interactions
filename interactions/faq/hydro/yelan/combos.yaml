    Yelan’s on-field inputs are extremely straightforward. You’re basically dealing with one of three possible combos.

      • *E, Q (Skill, Burst)*

      > - E and Q can be swapped to [Q, E] in any rotation, depending on needs.

      > - E during Q procs synchronized Burst attacks.

      • *B, E, Q (Breakthrough Barb Charged Shot, Skill, Burst)*

      > - This is usually on first rotation only, but it’s debatable whether the damage given by Breakthrough is worth the time it takes to perform it.

      • *Q N1 E N1 . . . N1 E N1*

      > - You use this combo in 23s rotations when using E every 10s. Auto’s are for Burst procs.

      The majority of the time, you’re simply using her Skill and Burst in some order and then swapping off for someone to take advantage of her late ascension buff.

- title: __Why 23s Rotations?__
  description: |-
    Sometimes, Yelan will want to use her E twice per rotation in order
    to get away with building less Energy Recharge. The less Energy Recharge she has
    to build, the more she can invest into offensive stats. When Yelan is freely able
    to invest in offensive stats, such as with Xingqiu wielding a Sacrificial Sword,
    she deals more than double Sac-Sword-Xingqiu’s damage. 
    
    23s is an estimate,
    but 22s is also a safe assumption. It takes about half of a second to use Yelan’s
    skill, and you’d have to recast E right after cooldown to keep the rotation down.
    Two E casts takes 21 seconds, but we also have to factor in human error. Knowing
    when her cooldown ends is essential to maximizing DPS in these rotations.
    
    There
    is, of course, a catch to opting into 23s rotations: since Yelan’s Burst lasts
    for 15 seconds and her Skill cooldown is 10 seconds. This means Yelan needs to
    return to the field while her Burst is active, which is why in some rotations,
    weaving N1’s into her moves can keep her Burst procs coming. 23s rotations
    are an option, not a requirement. As always, it depends on your team composition
    and gear.
