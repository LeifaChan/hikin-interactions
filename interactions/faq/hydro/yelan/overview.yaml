  description: |-

    Yelan is a Hydro Sub-DPS who uses her Elemental Burst to constantly deal impressive single-target damage while applying Hydro. At the time of writing this, her Burst cooldown is 18 seconds with a 70-cost Burst. Depending on your team composition and Energy Recharge, you will be playing either in a 23 second rotation where Yelan’s Skill is on cooldown every 10s, or running a shorter rotation with only one Skill cast.

    Considering the nature of Yelan's Burst, she's comparable to Xingqiu. Like Hoyoverse has done with multiple 5-star characters in the past, Yelan is a 5-star that sacrifices the utility of her 4-star counterpart’s modest healing, higher hydro application with melee characters, and damage reduction in exchange for raw damage.

    A critical divergence here is that Yelan scales entirely off of HP, rather than ATK. Since Yelan's Normal Attacks are not recommended, ***there is no useful part of her kit that benefits from ATK. Even high ATK weapons don't matter. Because HP buffs are rare, HP% rolls are disproportionately more valuable. A bonus of scaling off of HP is that usable artifacts have a higher likelihood of showing up for Yelan, saving valuable resin.

    Yelan's energy requirements are frankly massive. You will generally need to build around 225% Energy Recharge on Yelan, which will most often confine her to an Energy Recharge Bow or Sands of Eon, as well as the 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate set. Luckily, one of her best options for a weapon is one that every single Genshin Impact player has, the Favonius Warbow.

    Since Yelan scales off of her HP, leveling to 90 is beneficial, and her Normal Attack doesn't require any investment.
