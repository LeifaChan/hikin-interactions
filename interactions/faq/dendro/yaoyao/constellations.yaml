    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    C1 - Adeptus’ Tutelage
  description: |-
    *When White Jade Radishes explode, active characters within their AoE will gain 15% Dendro DMG Bonus for 8s and have 15 Stamina restored to them. This form of Stamina Restoration can only be triggered every 5s.*

    This Constellation provides a decent boost for Yaoyao’s Dendro teammate’s damage output, making it a decent Constellation in teams where Yaoyao is the 2nd Dendro on the team. The 15 Stamina restoration is also a quality of life in her teams as well.

- title: C2 - Innocent
  description: |-
    *While affected by the Adeptal Legacy state caused by Moonjade Descent, if White Jade Radish explosions damage opponents, 3 Energy will be restored to Yaoyao. This form of Energy regeneration can occur once every 0.8s.*

    After using her Burst, while Yaoyao is on-field, Jade Radishes that hit opponents refund 3 Energy to Yaoyao with a cooldown of 0.8 seconds. This Constellation helps with some Energy because she has an 80 Energy Cost on her Burst, but it could be inconsistent. This Constellation only is accounted for when Yaoyao is on-field while her Burst is active. In teams where she spends a significant time on-field during her Burst, this can be a pretty decent Constellation for reducing her Energy Cost. If used to its full extent, this can essentially reduce her Burst from an 80 Energy Cost to a 62 Energy Cost.

- title: C3 - Loyal and Kind
  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of Raphanus Sky Cluster by 3.
    Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

    Adds 3 levels to her Elemental Skill. Not much to say about this Constellation; it just increases the healing and damage of her Elemental Skill slightly. The healing portion can be somewhat relevant, since it can allow her to rely a bit more on her Skill for healing.

- title: C4 - Winsome
  description: |-
    *After using Raphanus Sky Cluster or Moonjade Descent, Yaoyao’s Elemental Mastery will be increased based on 0.3% of her Max HP for 8s. The maximum Elemental Mastery she can gain this way is 120.*

    After using her Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst, Yaoyao’s Elemental Mastery will be increased by 0.3% of her maximum HP. This bonus is capped at 120 Elemental Mastery. This Constellation can be good depending on the team you are playing. In Bloom teams such as Nilou’s with Candace, the EM bonus can help with your Bloom DMG. If you want to max this bonus out, it caps at 40,000 HP, which is easily achievable without having to go HP/HP/HP + Black Tassel .

- title: C5 - Compassionate
  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of Moonjade Descent by 3.
    Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

    Adds 3 levels to her Elemental Burst. Just like her skill, this Constellation just increases her healing and damage output slightly. As with her C3, the healing portion can be somewhat relevant as it allows you to gain more healing in Bloom teams if needed.

- title: C6 - Beneficient
  description: |-
    *For every 2 White Jade Radishes Yuegui: Throwing Mode throws out, it will also throw a Mega Radish that will have a larger AoE than the standard White Jade Radish and have the following effects upon exploding:
    ·Deals AoE Dendro DMG based on 75% of Yaoyao’s ATK.
    ·Restores HP for the active character based on 7.5% of Yaoyao’s Max HP.

    Every Yuegei: Throwing Mode can throw out a maximum of 2 Mega Radishes.*

    For every 2 White Jade Radishes Yuegui: Throwing Mode throws out, it will also throw a Mega Radish. This Constellation increases Yaoyao’s healing and damage output. The Mega Radish not only heals, but can also provide more Dendro applications for your team. Depending on the team, this can be a decent boost for her supporting capabilities. In Nilou Bloom, this allows her to build more EM assuming the Radish hits more than one enemy at the same time.
