      Since Yaoyao is a character who has heavy role consolidation and benefits
      from many different stats based on her teams, this leaves her with
      numerous build paths, and it can be confusing to players when deciding
      what the best option is. As such, when picking Yaoyao’s weapon, players
      should pay attention to what team she’s going to be played in, her field
      time in said team and what type of content they’re facing. Generally:


      [Nilou Bloom] are weapons that have a specific value in Nilou Bloom teams,
      be it Energy for frequent Bursts and/or high EM for her own Bountiful Core
      DMG.

      [Spread] are options specialized in providing Yaoyao with personal Spread
      DMG and are recommended in Spread/Aggravate teams (and some Hyperbloom
      teams), where Quicken aura has high uptime and her Burst has lower value.
      These usually boast offensive stats like CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG, EM, DMG Bonus
      or ATK.

      [Support] signifies Polearms that are highly flexible picks for most of
      Yaoyao’s teams, where she is used primarily for heals and Dendro
      application but can provide additional support value.


      Additionally, __Notable Options__ will go over a selection of Yaoyao’s
      most competitive weapons while __Other Options__ includes viable but
      situational ones.

      __Notable Options__

      Favonius Lance [Nilou Bloom] [Support]
    description: >-
      A flexible option that extends Yaoyao’s support capabilities by supplying
      the whole team with Energy through clear particles and enhances her with
      its ER secondary stat. It should be noted that the passive only triggers
      while the holder is on-field and requires them to build CRIT Rate, so
      generally, aim to perform Skill → N2 in teams where Yaoyao does not use
      her Burst frequently.

  - title: Kitain Cross Spear [Nilou Bloom] [Spread]
    description: >-
      Yaoyao can virtually utilize every facet of this weapon, from the EM
      secondary stat and Skill DMG Bonus to the Flat Energy generation. Most
      notably, the Energy generation passive lets Yaoyao Burst every rotation
      even with lower-ER builds. Contrary to its description, Kitain does not
      drain any Energy when the holder has none, but this does not affect
      Yaoyao’s rotations given Yuegui’s Radish hit delay after Skill usage.
      Overall, Kitain’s performance is amicable for Yaoyao in most situations
      and an exceptional one for Nilou teams.

  - title: Black Tassel [Nilou Bloom] [Support]
    description: >-
      The highest HP%-stat Polearm in the game and gives a direct boost to
      Yaoyao’s healing potency. Overall a capable weapon when it’s already
      leveled but can be substituted for HP% Sands + another ER weapon instead.

  - title: Deathmatch|Staff of Homa|Missive Windspear [Spread]
    description: >-
      Competitive Spread-focused Polearms, all of which provide nearly
      unconditional stat-buffing passives. This alongside their high inherent
      stats makes them stable and reliable options as opposed to Staff of the
      Scarlet Sands. Note that Missive Windspear’s passive will only be
      snapshotted onto Yaoyao’s Skill from the 2nd rotation onwards given its
      10s duration and Yuegui’s downtime.

      __Other Options__

      Moonpiercer [Support]
    description: >-
      A unique spear capable of providing a hefty ATK% buff (16%-32%) to another
      party member while granting Yaoyao with its offensive stats. With the ATK%
      buff only benefiting a single character and high uptime (12s duration/20s
      cooldown), Moonpiercer becomes an immensely valuable option for
      ATK-scaling hypercarries. Even though the Leaf placement can be finicky to
      deal with, the passive trigger condition (off-field compatible) keeps
      rotations relatively simple and controlled. In spite of that, its value
      drops significantly for rotations that aren't 20s.

  - title: Staff of the Scarlet Sands [Spread]
    description: >-
      Even for its 5-star status, this weapon boasts an extremely high CRIT Rate
      secondary stat (44.1%) and a stacking ATK passive that directly scales off
      Yaoyao’s EM, both of which make it one of her best options when built for
      Spread DMG on paper. But the value of this weapon becomes less impressive
      seeing as how Yaoyao is only able to gain the passive’s stacks while
      on-field and how her Skill/Burst snapshots. Which means that in order for
      Yaoyao to gain maximum value from the passive, she would have to spend 4s
      on-field to gain full stacks to then snapshot those stats onto her Burst.
      All things considered, Staff of the Scarlet Sands is usually not
      recommendable over more stable options, as Yaoyao is incapable of making
      full use of it, and should be in the hands of a more effective user in the
      team.

  - title: Dragon's Bane [Nilou Bloom] [Spread]
    description: >-
      As Quicken aura is not able to coexist with Hydro or Pyro aura and other
      Dendro reactions gain no value from DMG%, this weapon’s passive proves to
      be of no use to Yaoyao. Regardless, its high EM secondary stat makes it a
      usable stat stick when there are no better options.
