- title: __ER REQUIRMENTS__
  description: The table assumes Yaoyao Bursting every rotation. If she is Bursting
    every other rotation instead, she would not need to specifically build ER; in
    the worst case scenario she would need around 150% ER. C2 gives her 18 Flat Energy,
    which lowers her ER requirement by 30-40%.
