    <${EMOJIS.SANDS}> *Sands of Eon:* ER or EM
    <${EMOJIS.GOBLET}> *Goblet of Eonothem:* EM
    <${EMOJIS.CIRCLET}> *Circlet of Logos:* EM

    *ER or ATK/DMG/CRIT also work, although not necessarily recommended.*

    Kaveh’s damage scales off ATK, whereas his reaction damage and healing depend on EM. 

    For general purposes, **ER or EM/EM/EM** are the recommended mainstats. In Bloom teams, an EM build maximizes his healing while not being far off from other main stat combinations. Technically, ER or ATK/DMG/CRIT can be his best main stats in scenarios where he has little to no reaction ownership, but Kaveh’s personal damage outside of Bloom DMG is very minor. Optimizing his damage weakens his survivability in exchange for negligible gains to team DPS. Having better survivability on Kaveh is especially important if there’s no other healer and/or  he’s played on a Nilou team. Plus, the gap between the two combinations narrows the more Bloom ownership he gets.

    *Substats:* ER (until ER requirements are met) > CRIT Rate (if using Favonius Greatsword) > EM >= ATK% >= CRIT

    **ER**: Most of Kaveh’s utilities are locked behind his Elemental Burst. Needless to say, having enough ER to Burst every rotation is first priority. Check the above section or use an ER calculator to determine how much ER you’ll need.

    **EM**:  EM is helpful for both reaction damage and Kaveh's healing. With C1 active, he needs about 300-400 EM to out-heal Blooms, Bountiful Blooms, or Burgeons triggered by a teammate with 1000 EM. Since C1 only has about 50% uptime, expect to build at least 500-600 EM. In fact, you'll probably even want more EM since enemies will also be damaging you or if Kaveh is C0. If you're already running a healer, EM isn't as necessary. Check the mastersheet for more details on EM thresholds.

    **ATK%/CRIT**: Kaveh tends to be ATK deficient to the point that ATK% rolls can be better than CRIT ones. CRIT can be better once you have enough ATK and if you’re using Favonius Greatsword — use optimizer if you’re unsure.
