    **4PC Ocean-hued Clam**  
  description: >-
    Even at C0, OHC competes for Kaveh’s BiS along with 4PC Deepwood Memories, and gets even better at C1. Because his DPS profile isn’t so great, the extra damage OHC brings is much appreciated, along with the additional healing. OHC works best in Bloom teams where Kaveh can easily trigger his A1 Passive, and to a lesser extent, Burgeon teams as well. Based on the wording, Kaveh must be damaged by Dendro Cores to heal himself, so shields will nullify his A1 effect. Hyperblooms have small AoE and don’t always hit the user, meaning Kaveh’s A1 cannot reliably be triggered in such teams. And of course, in pure Quicken comps, there are no Dendro Cores that can proc this Passive, rendering OHC useless.

    **4PC Deepwood Memories**
  description: >-
    A generalist support set — it is particularly good if Kaveh is the only Dendro character and no one else can hold it. Because his teams are centered around Dendro, the 30% Dendro RES Shred is invaluable, and the 2PC is also useful. With a 6s CD on his Elemental Skill, it is feasible for him to maintain full uptime on the 4PC effect. 
    
    
    Players should be conscious about their rotations and cast Kaveh’s Skill every 6-8s, otherwise there will be gaps in the 4PC uptime.  Even if Kaveh isn’t holding this set, make sure another teammate is —  you absolutely want this set for all Dendro teams!

    **4PC Instructor**
  description: >-
    Although Instructor is only a 4-star set, its party-wide 120 EM share is highly desired in Kaveh’s teams. Due to its low rarity, artifact stats are lower, but Kaveh’s damage is low to begin with. Sacrificing his DPS output in exchange for increasing his team’s damage is a worthwhile trade (Kaveh also benefits from the 2PC and 4PC effect). What’s problematic is that uptime on the 4PC effect may suffer, because Kaveh typically does not trigger many reactions in his teams.

    **2PC Mix/Match (18% ATK/20% ER/15% Dendro DMG/80 EM)** 
  description: >-
    Transitionary sets. The best combination depends on the substats and what team you’re playing, but 20% ER is almost always useful.

    **4PC Flower of Paradise Lost**
  description: >-
    This set should only be considered if Kaveh is triggering a high to moderate amount of Blooms (e.g teams with high Hydro application and/or low Dendro application or if Kaveh is the only Dendro character). In such scenarios, FoPL is quite strong.

    **4PC Gilded Dreams** 
  description: >-
    Like 4PC FoPL, this set isn’t particularly noteworthy unless Kaveh has a high to moderate ownership of Blooms. It’s slightly worse than 4PC FoPL, and could have uptime issues. 
    
    
    On the contrary, it does provide better healing, and you’ll likely have a set if you were already farming DW.
