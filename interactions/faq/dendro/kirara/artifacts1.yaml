    <${EMOJIS.SANDS}> *Sands of Eon:* HP%

    <${EMOJIS.CIRCLET}> *Circlet of Logos:* HP%

    Due to Kirara having very little damage contribution, maximizing her Skill’s shielding utility by building her purely on HP% as a shieldbot is the best way to make use of her kit. On top of that, Kirara’s Ascension 4 Passive introduces additional HP% scalings to her Meow-teor Kick and Elemental Burst, allowing her to sneak some extra damage even if her build is full HP%.

    Unlike Baizhu, Kirara does not require a Burst activation to deploy defensive utility, which she can provide with her Skill instead. This means unless the player is willing to play her purely for her Burst, there is no requirement to build ER% on her. 

    **Substats:** ER% (Until ER Reqs are met) > HP%/HP > ATK%/ATK/CRIT%/CRIT DMG%
