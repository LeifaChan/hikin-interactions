    **Kirara | Nilou | Hydro | Dendro**

    Being a Dendro Unit, Kirara can easily slot into Bloom teams as a survivability slot which can play both off and on-field scenarios. However, as stated before, a stronger Dendro applicator like Nahida is recommended to make up for her lacking application.

    The possibility of on-field Kirara as a Dendro applicator in her Urgent Neko Parcel state requires further testing.

    **Hyperbloom / Burgeon**

    Aside from Kirara's general utility leaning towards defense, her viability as a Dendro driver for Burgeon/Hyperbloom during the Urgent Neko Parcel state is questionable and requires further testing. Since Kirara is unable to trigger Normal Attacks during this state, any Hydro application using Xingqiu or Yelan is not possible, which limits options for a Hydro applicator in such teams.

    It is important to note that unlocking Kirara’s C4 potentially allowing her to function as an off-field Dendro applicator with shield capabilities for **hyperbloom teams**. More testing is needed on both her C4 and Hold Skill capabilities in this scenario.

    __**Teammates**__

    <${EMOJIS.ELECTRO}> **Electro (Quickbloom options):** Cyno / Raiden / Kuki / Yae / Fischl

    <${EMOJIS.HYDRO}> **Hydro options:** Xingqiu / Yelan / Kokomi / Ayato
