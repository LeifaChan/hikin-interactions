    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    **Constellation 1 - Material Circulation**
  description: |-
   > *Every 8,000 Max HP Kirara possesses will cause her to create 1 extra Cat Grass Cardamom when she uses Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch. A maximum of 4 extra can be created this way.*

   Gives Kirara the ability to create up to 4 extra bomblets depending on her Max HP, which is very likely if you were to build her as a shieldbot. A nice bit of extra Dendro application which could situationally be useful, although her damage is still nothing special.

    **Constellation 2 - Perfectly Packaged**
  description: |-
    > *When Kirara is in the Urgent Neko Parcel state of Meow-teor Kick, she will grant other party members she crashes into Critical Transport Shields.*
    > 
    > *The DMG absorption of Critical Transport Shield is 40% of the maximum absorption Meow-teor Kick's normal Shields of Safe Transport are capable of, and will absorb Dendro DMG with 250% effectiveness.*
    > 
    > *Critical Transport Shields last 12s and can be triggered once on each character every 10s.*

    A Constellation that is nice in co-op, granting mini-shields to allies who Kirara collides with. That being said, these shields can only be created in co-op, rendering this Constellation worthless in normal play.
