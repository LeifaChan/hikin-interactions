    __TALENT OVERVIEW__
    
    **Normal Attack: Boxcutter**
  description: |-
    Kirara has attack multipliers that are similar to Shinobu’s throughout her Normal Attack sequence. Unfortunately, with abysmally low base attack and no other added gimmicks to it, there is little to no reason to make use of her attack string unless you specifically wish to build her to do so.

    **Elemental Skill: Meow-teor Kick**
  description: |-
    *CD (Tap)* : ***8s***
    *CD (Hold)* : ***12s***

    There are two variations to Kirara’s Skill — a pressed and a held version. Her Tap Skill initiates a **Tail-Flicking Flying Kick**, dealing AoE Dendro DMG while briefly applying Dendro to herself. It will also create a **Shield of Safe Transport** that lasts for 12s, the duration of which will be refreshed if a new shield is applied on top of it.
    
    Her Hold Skill deploys a shield similar to the one that is created from her pressed Skill. On top of this, Kirara will curl up into a box, dealing damage to enemies she crashes into in a fashion similar to Sayu’s Skill. At the end of her Skill, she will unleash a **Flipclaw Strike**, dealing AoE Dendro DMG. The longer her Skill is held, the longer its cooldown will be at the end.

    It’s worth noting that in the held Skill state, Kirara’s movement and climbing speed will be increased, making it possible for her to traverse climbable terrain more quickly in her box state at the cost of increased stamina consumption.

    Kirara’s shields also have increased Dendro absorption, meaning that she could be an option for certain bloom-based teams.

    **Elemental Burst: Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch**
  description: |-
    *CD* : ***15s***
    *Energy Cost* : ***60***
    
    Kirara smashes enemies with a **Special Delivery Package**, dealing a large chunk of AoE Dendro DMG to enemies. After the explosion, the package will split up into a total of 6 **Cat Grass Cardamoms**, little bomblets similar to Klee’s. When enemies come into contact with said bomblets OR if left alone for 12 seconds, they will explode, dealing AoE Dendro DMG to enemies surrounding them. A nice bit of extra damage along with Dendro application, though her primary utility as a shieldbot means that the damage might not be as impactful as the numbers imply.
