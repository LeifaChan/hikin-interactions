  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Collei is a Dendro Support unit who offers fertile ground for chain
      reactions from other party members. Between the three Dendro characters
      introduced in 3.0 (including the Traveler), Collei is the only Dendro unit
      capable of sustaining Burning reactions while off-field, creating a
      special niche. 


      The majority of her damage comes from her Burst, and her personal damage
      benefits from the new Spread reaction. Her Burst also has the most
      frequent Dendro application of her kit at C0, maxing at four instances.
      Constellations change this in favor of her Skill.


      To reliably Burst, Collei requires lots of Energy Recharge, as well as
      particle generation from characters like Raiden, Fischl, or other Dendro
      characters. It is recommended, then, to use an Energy Recharge weapon or
      Sands of Eon. 


      Being a bow-wielder, Collei has access to the team-buffing Elegy for the
      End, which also provide all the stats she wants, and has access to
      excellent artifact sets in the new Deepwood set, which shreds Dendro
      resistance, or Noblesse Oblige providing the much-appreciated 20% teamwide
      ATK buff and 20% personal Burst damage. 


      Collei's Constellations focus on improving her personal damage and Dendro
      Application. By C6, her raw damage is increased by roughly 30%, mostly via
      C2, C5 and C6. Furthermore C2 and C6 grant her 1 additional Dendro
      application each, improving her ability to benefit from or enable more
      Dendro Reactions.
