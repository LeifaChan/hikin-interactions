      Collei’s on-field inputs are extremely straightforward. You’re basically
      dealing with one of three possible combos.


      **__E, Q (Skill, Burst)__**

      Recommended over “Q, E” so Collei doesn’t waste time on-field waiting for
      her particles.


      **__N1, tCA, E, Q (Normal Attack, Tap-Charged Attack, Skill, Burst)__**

      This should only be used while equipping the Polar Star, in order to
      guarantee as many stacks as possible.


      **__N2D (Two Normal Attacks, followed by a cancel (aim, dash, jump) of your
      choice)__**

      This is only for the people that really, really, really want to use
      Collei’s low-damage auto’s.


      The majority of the time, you’re simply using her Skill and Burst in some
      order and then swapping off for someone to take advantage of
      transformative reactions or Aggravate.
