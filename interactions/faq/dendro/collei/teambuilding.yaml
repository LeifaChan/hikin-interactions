  - title: TEAMBUILDING
    description: >-
      Since Dendro needs heavy testing before we can make conclusive team comps,
      what follows here, instead, is a loose guide on constructing a team based
      on the reactions Collei can facilitate. The characters listed are only
      suggestions.

      Aggravate Teams
      
      Electro / Electro / Collei / Flex
    description: >-
      Aggravate focuses on increasing an Electro DPS’s damage, and can only be
      triggered while Quicken is active.


      Quicken occurs when Dendro and Electro hit an enemy, adding a flat damage
      buff, much like Shenhe and Yunjin’s talents against that enemy for as long
      as they are affected by the Dendro Aura applied by Quicken.

      **Electro:** Fischl, Miko, Shinobu, Keqing, and most other Electro characters.


      **Flex:** Kazuha, Jean, Sayu, Sucrose, Zhongli

      __**Pyro and Hydro can interfere with Quicken, so they are generally not
      advised in these teams.**__

      Spread Teams

      Dendro / Collei / Electro / Flex
    description: >-
      Spread focuses on increasing a Dendro DPS’s damage, and can only be
      triggered when the Quicken reaction is active.


      Quicken occurs when Dendro and Electro hit an enemy, adding a flat damage
      buff, much like Shenhe and Yunjin’s talents against that enemy for as long
      as they are affected by the Dendro Aura applied by Quicken.

      - **Dendro:** Tighnari, Traveler


      - **Electro:** Fischl, Miko, Shinobu


      - **Flex** Zhongli, or whatever your team needs. Anemo cannot swirl Dendro, but
      it can still swirl Electro if that’s of interest still.

      Burning Teams

      Collei / Pyro /  Pyro / Flex
    description: >-
      Burning combines Dendro and Pyro to deal rapid Pyro damage over time that
      scales with Elemental Mastery. Burning Teams utilize Collei’s
      specialization as an off-field Burning sustainer.


      The viability of Melting and/or Overloading off of Burning is uncertain at
      the moment and thus not covered in further detail.


      Collei will usually still be best off with [ER or ATK] / DMG / CRIT
      artifacts, even when the trigger element.

      - **Pyro:** Klee, Xiangling, Bennett, Thoma, but no perfect fits right now.


      - **Flex:** Kazuha, Sucrose, Jean, Sayu, Zhongli, or a Pyro character.

  - title: Bloom Teams
    description: >-
      Rupture teams focus more on making as many Blooms as possible, since one
      Bloom will automatically detonate when there are more than five on the
      field. Otherwise, Rupture takes about five seconds to occur without
      elemental interference, dealing damage to everyone caught in the blast
      (you only take a very small fraction of this).

      Rupture damage is *exactly* equal to Overload in terms of damage.

      Double Hydro Bloom

      Collei/Hydro/Hydro/Anemo

    description: >-
      - Hydro: Tartaglia, Yelan, Xingqiu, Mona, Kokomi

      - Anemo: Kazuha, Jean, Sayu, Sucrose

      Tartaglia is the only character at the moment who can apply enough Hydro
      *on his own.*

      Fridge Team

      Collei/Hydro/Cryo/Anemo

    description: >-
      
      It’s important to note that Frozen enemies preserve a Dendro aura for
      longer, allowing for more Blooms to occur.


      If there is a character released that auto-Rupture’s Blooms, this strategy
      will see more play.

      - Cryo or Anemo can be swapped out for a different Hydro unit. High Hydro
      application is extremely important.


      - Hydro: Tartaglia, Yelan, Xingqiu, Mona, Kokomi

      Tartaglia is the only character at the moment who can apply enough Hydro
      *on his own.*


      - Cryo: Rosaria, Kaeya, Ayaka, Ganyu, Diona (though Diona’s application
      isn’t great)


      - Anemo: Kazuha, Jean, Sayu, Sucrose

      Hyperbloom and Burgeon
    description: >-
      Hyperbloom and Burgeon that Dendro Cores have their own elemental app
      icds, so any attack that can apply Electro/Pyro will trigger
      Hyperbloom/Burgeon.


      Two characters are particularly good triggers for these reactions. despite
      their otherwise unimpressive elemental application rate.


      - Hyperbloom: Shinobu 


      - Burgeon: Thoma
    color: 3450963

  - title: >-
      Hyperbloom

      Collei/Dendro/Hydro/Electro
      
    description: >-
      Hyperbloom teams utilize Electro application on Blooms in order to create
      single-target Electro attacks.
       
      At time of writing this, building a Hyperbloom team is difficult, due to
      the need to balance individual damage output with sustaining enough
      reactions to make the strategy matter. 

      - Dendro: Tighnari or Traveler


      - Hydro: Tartaglia, Yelan, Xingqiu, Mona, Kokomi


      - Electro: Fischl, Miko, Shinobu, and most other Electro characters.

  - title: >-
      Burgeon

      Collei/Hydro/Pyro/Flex
    description: >-  
      Burgeon teams utilize Pyro application on Blooms in order to create AOE
      Pyro explosions that damage everyone caught in the blast (you only take a
      very small fraction of this).


      Pyro ***always*** gets ownership of the reaction, so build your Elemental
      Mastery on this character.


      Bloom consumes a *lot* of Hydro. To simultaneously trigger Burgeon and
      Vaporize reactions, you have two choices:


      Bring *lots* of Hydro application from someone like Childe to work with
      Pyro DPS units like Xiangling.


      Bring only a Pyro unit with slow application, like Thoma, to ensure Pyro
      doesn't overtake the Hydro aura on an enemy – overtaking Hydro will halt
      Bloom/Burgeon reactions.

      - Hydro: Tartaglia, Yelan, Xingqiu, Mona, Kokomi


      - Pyro: Thoma, Bennett, Xiangling.


      - Flex: Hydro/Pyro/Anemo/Zhongli
