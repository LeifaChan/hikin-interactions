      C1 : Deepwood Patrol
    description: >-
      While the constellation says that Collei gains 20% Energy Recharge,
      in practice, it’s less than that – more like 14%. This is because Collei,
      to maximize her energy intake, must be on-field to absorb the Dendro
      particles she generates.

      C2 : Through Hill and Copse
    description: >-
      Essentially, this extends the length of Collei’s Skill uptime,
      allowing for more opportunities for Dendro application and damage. For the
      sake of conservative estimates, I assumed this gave only one extra Spread
      instance. A safe stopping point.

      C3 : Scent of Summer
    description: >-
      Three talent levels added to Collei’s Skill. Not a significant
      increase, as her damage comes from her Burst.

      C4 : Gift of the Woods
    description: >-
      Grants 60 Elemental Mastery to all party members but herself. As
      such, this is good for team damage, but has zero impact on her personal
      damage.

      C5 : All Embers
    description: >-
      Three talent levels added to the Burst is a welcome boon. Tied for
      the most beneficial constellation with C6 and C2.

      C6 : Forest of Falling Arrows
    description: >-
      C6 – Adds yet another Spread instance in the form of a Culein-Anbar attack
      at 200% of Collei’s ATK.
