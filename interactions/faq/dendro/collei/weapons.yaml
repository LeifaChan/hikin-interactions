      It’s hard to rank these weapons, as many of them are best when factoring
      in a whole team, even if they’re not the best in personal damage.

  - title: Elegy For the End [ATK% Sands >= EM Sands]
    description: >-
      The most stable 5-star choice. An excellent balance of damage and team
      support.

  - title: Polar Star  [ER% Sands]
    description: >-
      Strongest in terms of personal damage, but offers no team utility and
      requires its own rotation to get used to. 8% more damage than Elegy in
      best-case scenarios.

  - title: Aqua Simulacra [ER% Sands]
    description: >-
      Approximately matches Elegy’s personal damage with Collei, but Elegy buffs
      the team.

  - title: Stringless R5 / Mourn’s Moon R5 [ER% Sands]
    description: >-
      Stringless performs worse on Emblem of Severed Fate, but trails only 2%
      behind Aqua Simulacra on Deepwood.

  - title: Favonius Warbow [ATK% Sands >= EM Sands]
    description: >-
      Favonius weapons are just extremely powerful. They lower ER requirements
      with their passives, allowing you to build more offense and smooth out the
      rest of your team’s rotation. If your Energy Recharge requirement would
      *normally* be 200%, it becomes 170% instead.

      Optional : Sacrificial Bow
    description: >-


      Some weapons in the mastersheet are listed in a different order, placed,
      higher, or not listed at all. Sacrificial Bow is one of these weapons.
      Sacrificial Bow looks good on paper, compared to R5 Stringless, but it
      only reaches this damage after you’ve significantly altered your
      rotation. 


      The reason for this is that Collei’s Skill only applies Dendro on the
      throwing of the boomerang once per 5 seconds, similar to how Ningguang’s
      Jade Screen can only generate energy once every 5-6 seconds. This means to
      maximize Spread instances you have to wait for her boomerang to return
      most of the time in order to get the damage boost from an additional
      Spread reaction. Since Spread accounts for around 30%+ of her personal
      damage, this is a significant loss. You either stay on the field as Collei
      and deal mediocre damage, cutting into team DPS for the rotation, or you
      interrupt your rotation to switch to Collei, use her Skill, and swap out. 


      Because of this, I do not recommend Sacrificial Bow to most players,
      especially since it extends rotations when below refinement 5, due to
      passive cooldown time. Prototype Crescent can also compete, but only
      post-headshot, and it takes time to set up a reliable headshot, lowering
      DPS in the long run.
