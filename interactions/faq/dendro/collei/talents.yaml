  - title: Normal Attacks
    description: >-
      Normal Attacks are unimpressive, and her Aimed Shot is standard for 4-star
      units. Diehard Collei loyalists, however, can use charged shots to trigger
      Quicken, Spread, or Bloom.

  - title: Elemental Skill
    description: >-
      Collei’s Skill throws a boomerang that applies Dendro on hit. It can hit
      on throw and when the boomerang returns to Collei. On return, it creates a
      Sprout if Collei is properly ascended, dealing another instance of Dendro
      damage. Her Skill then applies Dendro about three times at C0, but
      improves with constellations.

  - title: Elemental Burst
    description: >-
      Collei’s Burst is more than 70% of her total damage output, making her
      Burst the most important Talent to level. Her Skill should be leveled
      insofar as she deals Dendro damage and will often be holding a Dendro
      DMG%o Goblet. 

      
      The Burst is 6-seconds long, but can be extended to 9 after initiating a
      Dendro-based elemental reaction – something you should be doing anyways as
      soon as Collei takes the field. 19 hits take place during the Burst, but
      due to the ICD being every 2.5 seconds without a hit-based cooldown,
      Collei can only apply Dendro a maximum of four times with her Burst.

  - title: Ascension Passive
    description: >-
      As previously mentioned, the first ascension passive talent applies a
      negligible instance of Dendro damage via Collei’s ‘Sprout.’ The latter
      ascension passive talent extends the duration of her Burst – this is a
      must have, so ascend Collei to at least lvl 60/70 ASAP if you intend to
      use her.

  - title: Overworld Utility Passive Talents
    description: >-
      Her passive exploration talent, much like her girlfriend, Amber, reduces
      gliding stamina consumption by 20%.
