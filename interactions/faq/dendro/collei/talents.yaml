      **Leveling priority: Burst > Skill >> Normal Attack**


      Analysis:


      Collei’s Burst is more than 70% of her total damage output, making her
      Burst the most important Talent to level. Her Skill should be leveled
      insofar as she deals Dendro damage and will often be holding a Dendro
      DMG%o Goblet. 


      The Burst is 6-seconds long, but can be extended to 9 after initiating a
      Dendro-based elemental reaction – something you should be doing anyways as
      soon as Collei takes the field. 19 hits take place during the Burst, but
      due to the ICD being every 2.5 seconds without a hit-based cooldown,
      Collei can only apply Dendro a maximum of four times with her Burst.


      Collei’s Skill throws a boomerang that applies Dendro on hit. It can hit
      on throw and when the boomerang returns to Collei. On return, it creates a
      Sprout if Collei is properly ascended, dealing another instance of Dendro
      damage. Her Skill then applies Dendro about three times at C0, but
      improves with constellations.


      Normal Attacks are unimpressive, and her Aimed Shot is standard for 4-star
      units. Diehard Collei loyalists, however, can use charged shots to trigger
      Quicken, Spread, or Bloom.


      As previously mentioned, the first ascension passive talent applies a
      negligible instance of Dendro damage via Collei’s ‘Sprout.’ The latter
      ascension passive talent extends the duration of her Burst – this is a
      must have, so ascend Collei to at least lvl 60/70 ASAP if you intend to
      use her.


      Her passive exploration talent, much like her girlfriend, Amber, reduces
      gliding stamina consumption by 20%.
