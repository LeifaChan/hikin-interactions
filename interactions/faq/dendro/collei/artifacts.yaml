      There are a few artifact options available, depending on your preference.


      **ER / DMG / CRIT**

      The safe default option when NOT equipping an Energy Recharge weapon.

      **ATK / DMG / CRIT**

      The safe default option when you ARE equipping an Energy Recharge weapon.

      **EM / DMG / CRIT**

      Awkward in-between arrangement. Comparable to ATK when focused on Spread.

      **ER / EM / EM**

      The Bloom  (trigger-focused) option while equipping an EM weapon.

      **EM / EM / EM**

      The Bloom (trigger-focused) option while equipping an ER weapon.


      The Sands of Eon should ***always*** be ER if your ER needs are not met.
      Equipping an Energy Recharge weapon gives room for an ATK Sands.  If you
      equip a weapon like Favonius Warbow or Elegy for the End, ATK will be a
      stable choice. An EM timepiece, after factoring in Spread damage, will be
      about equal in damage to an ATK sands, but without reactions, damage will
      significantly fall off.


      For comparing Burning damage, we assume ten total seconds of uptime for
      Burning, with Collei as the Trigger. Burning deals four instances of
      damage per second, for up to two seconds before running out of Dendro
      “fuel” to burn. Collei can apply Dendro seven times at C0 between Skill
      and Burst, but there is overlap in applications that prematurely reset the
      timer. As such, we knock off about four seconds from the expected total.
      This gives us forty instances of Burning damage, which based on the
      Transformative Reaction formula, is equivalent to five Overload reactions.


      At 700 Elemental Mastery with high Burning/Bloom ownership, Collei does
      respectable damage, comparable to the ATK build. However, it is much more
      difficult to obtain an EM/EM/EM Set of equal quality compared to an ATK /
      DMG / CRIT Set. EM Build has much more to *lose* if Collei lacks high
      reaction ownership, which will vary based on the teams she is used in.


      Since Bloom into Rupture is the same damage (exactly) as Overload, and
      Collei can trigger more than five Bloom reactions in a rotation, six or
      more Ruptures deal more damage than 40 ticks of Burning damage.


      Only a few 4pc sets compete for Best-in-Slot for Collei.

  - title: Deepwood  Memories
    description: >-
      Best-in-slot. Shreds Dendro resistance while providing a Dendro DMG bonus.
      Hyperbloom and Burgeon both deal Dendro damage, so this ***does not only
      support Dendro characters*** Deepwood Memories is functional on every character and
      most characters can benefit from the Dendro resistance shred.Don’t sleep
      on farming for this set.

  - title: Noblesse Oblige
    description: >-
      The de-facto support set. If you’re okay with sacrificing personal damage
      and simply want to stack buffs for your teammates, this is your best bet.

  - title: Emblem of Severed Fate
    description: >-
      At 200% Energy Recharge, competes toe-to-toe with Deepwood for personal
      damage, but offers no support capabilities and requires a dedicated build
      to match.

  - title: Instructor
    description: >-
      Available in 4-star only, but an alternative buffing set when the team
      prefers an Elemental Mastery buff over ATK.

      Available in 4-star only, but an alternative energy generation source when
      the team is energy hungry.

      The Best-in-Slot artifact set is the 4pc Deepwood set. It provides 15%
      Dendro DMG and offers a Viridescent-Venerer-like effect, shredding Dendro
      resistance. This effect can be triggered by *anyone* equipped with this
      set. Deepwood benefits Collei’s personal damage as well as any Dendro
      teammates she’s paired with. It is the best balance of personal damage and
      support.

      The 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate is equivalent in damage only at 200% ER,
      but loses the bonus team utility. The default support option is, of
      course, 4pc Noblesse Oblige, though 4pc Exile and 4pc Instructor will also
      work for team utility, if they need it.
