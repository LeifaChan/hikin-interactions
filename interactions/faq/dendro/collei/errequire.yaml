    description: >-
      In typical, 20-second rotations, Collei will need around 200% Energy
      Recharge due to the long 12s cooldown on her Skill inadequately charging
      her 60-cost Burst. Collei will mostly be contributing damage and
      application for reactions off-field. 


      In longer rotations and/or in teams with many rich energy sources, these
      energy needs may drop to 160% or lower. Equipping weapons like an R5
      Sacrificial Bow or a Favonius Warbow at any refinement rank can also
      reduce these needs. We strongly advise the use of an Energy Recharge
      calculator to plan.


      The top 5 sources of energy for Collei are


      1. Raiden Shogun

      2. Fischl (due to not having caveats)

      2. Traveler (Electro, Dendro, or even Geo, equipped with Favonius Sword
      and two Skill uses)

      3. Tighnari (25-second rotation, two Skill uses)

      5. Most other characters that can use two Skills in a rotation and carry a
      Favonius Weapon


      The Raiden Shogun and Fischl, who are both Electro units that benefit from
      Quicken and Aggravate reactions, are by far the best choices for
      controlling Collei’s energy needs. Her Dendro application will also offer
      a respectable buff to Raiden and a quite exploitable buff to Fischl,
      utilizing Fischl’s A4 passive. 


      It is only recommended to run one other Dendro member at most, due to
      Dendro’s tendency to want to interact with more than one outside element.


      Additionally, Taser teams involving Fischl, Kokomi, Xingqiu, Sucrose, and
      the like, generate lots of energy and require a long rotation. Taser and
      Raiden-Fischl teams will minimize Collei’s energy needs the most (though
      it’s not currently known whether that translates to most damage).
