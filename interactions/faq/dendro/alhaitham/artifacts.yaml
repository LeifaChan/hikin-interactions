- title: __ARTIFACTS__
  description: |-
    **Sands:** EM > ATK%
    **Goblet:** Dendro DMG% > EM
    **Circlet:** CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG > EM

    **Substats:** EM (~250-300) > CRIT% > EM > ATK% > Flat ATK

    With EM scaling on his Talents, a Passive that gives DMG% based on EM, and teams built around reactions, it’s no surprise that EM is a valuable stat on Alhaitham that will almost always be better than ATK. If using his signature weapon *Light of Foliar Incision*, EM becomes even more important. The 250-300 EM threshold is recommended on Quicken/Quickbloom builds before building CRIT substats, but with an EM Sands, external EM buffs, EM artifact sets, etc. there should be little issue reaching this range.

- title: "*What about ER?*"
  description: At higher ER requirements, building ER to Burst every rotation can
    be a DPS loss. Bursting every rotation at 130-140% ER requirements is roughly
    equivalent to Bursting every other rotation at 100% ER. Whichever option players
    go for depends on Alhaitham’s ER requirements, what artifacts they already have,
    and their playstyle preference.

    __Artifact Sets__

    4PC Gilded Dreams
  description: Alhaitham’s BiS set, provided that another character can hold 4pc Deepwood
    Memories. This set gives him a hefty amount of EM, a stat he greatly appreciates.
    Although it has a bit of downtime, its 4pc effect is relatively easy to trigger.

- title: 2PC EM/EM/Deepwood Memories
  description: Only slightly weaker than 4pc Gilded Dreams. If players have high substat
    quality on their 2pc sets (which they likely do), it is possible that this combination
    of artifacts will overtake 4pc Gilded Dreams.

- title: 4PC Deepwood Memories
  description: This is technically Alhaitham’s BiS set if no other character can hold
    it to proc the 4pc effect. However, Alhaitham typically deals the most damage
    in his teams, so it is advised to have another support unit hold 4pc Deepwood
    and him hold another artifact set instead. In this way, he can benefit from both
    artifact sets at the same time.

- title: 2PC Emblem of Severed Fate/EM/Deepwood Memories
  description: When Bursting every rotation, 2pc Emblem is a very competitive 2pc
    option and comes close to 4 Gilded Dreams, allowing players to build offensive
    substats instead of ER. Of course, at lower requirements, it is relatively less
    powerful.

- title: 2PC ATK%/ATK%
  description: A weaker 2pc variation than 2pc 80 EM/15% DMG. Not recommended, but
    technically better than having no set.

- title: 4PC Gladiator's Finale/Emblem of Severed Fate/etc.
  description: Not recommended. Alhaitham’s damage is distributed throughout his kit.
    Hence, it is counterproductive to use sets that focus on a singular aspect of
    his kit.
