  description: Alhaitham has a variety of weapon options at his disposal thanks to
    his flexible scaling taking advantage of a wide number of stats. Thanks to his
    reliance on EM over ATK making low Base ATK relatively inconsequential, he has
    many powerful free options. You can view the full weapon ranking in the [WFP Alhaitham
    Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17AGoQCMsX4MymsIwgtUsdMO-NhYTixC6d8RbkYred2c/edit#gid=1588964959).

    __Signature Weapon__

    Light of Foliar Incision
  description: Alhaitham’s signature weapon gives a hefty 88.2% CRIT DMG and provides
    an EM-scaling buff to his Normal Attacks and Projection Attacks. It is approximately
    8% stronger than the next best option, although its effectiveness is impacted
    in AoE situations where Alhaitham can use up its buff stacks prematurely on lower-scaling
    Normal Attacks rather than on Projection Attacks that benefit from A4. Foliar’s
    passive does, however, synergize well with EM buffs and makes him strongly favor
    EM in his build. Note that due to his lack of CRIT Rate ascension, it can be difficult
    to get a 1:2 crit ratio with Foliar.

    __5★ Options__

    Primordial Jade Cutter
  description: The evergreen stat stick, Primordial Jade Cutter is the 2nd-best option
    for Alhaitham after his signature weapon, thanks to its CRIT Rate stat and unconditional
    ATK bonus passive, both of which Alhaitham can take advantage of.

- title: Haran Geppaku Futsu
  description: Tied for 3rd place with Mistsplitter. Alhaitham enjoys its CRIT Rate
    and Elemental DMG Bonus buff. In order to make full use of its Normal Attack DMG
    buff, he should use N3D combos.

- title: Mistsplitter Reforged
  description: Tied for 3rd place with Haran. Alhaitham can make good use of Mistsplitter’s
    Elemental DMG Bonus passive, and he’s able to reliably maintain 3 stacks in most
    rotations.

    __4★ Options__

    Toukabou Shigure/Iron Sting
  description: |-
    His best 4-star options, Toukabou Shigure and Iron Sting perform similarly. Between their Elemental Mastery and passive buffs, they both provide everything Alhaitham values in a weapon.

    Due to their differing passives, Toukabou Shigure will perform better in single-target scenarios, while Iron Sting will pull ahead in AoE situations.

- title: Festering Desire
  description: A respectable option for Alhaitham that provides useful DMG% and CRIT
    Rate buffs for his Mirror Projection Attacks. Festering Desire is competitive
    with Iron Sting and Toukabou Shigure in teams where he can take full advantage
    of its Energy Recharge stat, but sees worse performance if he does not Burst every
    rotation.

- title: Xiphos' Moonlight
  description: Alhaitham values all the stats given by this weapon, which also reduces
    team Energy needs. However, Xiphos’ passive does not work with many EM buffs,
    lowering its overall effectiveness.

- title: Sacrificial Sword
  description: Sacrificial Sword offers Alhaitham the luxury of starting rotations
    with his Elemental Skill prior to Elemental Burst (changing his rotation to E
    > N1 > Q > E), allowing him to Burst with 2 Mirrors for additional damage. His
    typical rotations require R4 minimum to trigger consistently.

- title: Harbinger of Dawn
  description: Not to be discounted. With its passive up, Harbinger of Dawn competes
    with his 5-star weapon options, performing similarly to Haran and Mistsplitter
    thanks to its CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG buffs. However, given Alhaitham’s role as
    an on-field character, a shielder is mandatory to realistically take advantage
    of this weapon.
