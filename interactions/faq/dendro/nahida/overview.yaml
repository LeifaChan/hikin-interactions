- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Nahida is a 5* Dendro character who can be played as an on-field driver or
     off-field buffer. The majority of her damage comes from the mark applied
      by her Elemental Skill, which is further buffed from her A4 passive.
      Nahida’s Elemental Burst also gives different effects to her Skill
      depending on the amount of Pyro, Hydro or Electro members in her party, as
      well as granting an EM buff that reaches up to 250 EM to the on-field
      character through her A1 passive.


      Her Normal / Charged Attacks have a high frequency of application, making
      her a great on-field driver / enabler for many team compositions. Her
      Charged Attack can also be canceled very quickly, although at the cost of
      stamina.


      Nahida’s Elemental Skill has both a press and a hold form and applies 1U
      Dendro with no ICD. Pressing her Elemental Skill does a quick AoE hit of
      Dendro DMG and marks enemies with the **Seed of Skandha**. Holding her
      Elemental Skill allows Nahida to enter an aiming mode, which will mark up
      to a maximum of 8 enemies when aimed at. During this time, Nahida’s
      interruption resistance will also be increased.


      Enemies marked by the Seed of Skandha will be linked to one another,
      signified by green chains between enemies. Triggering an Elemental
      Reaction or dealing damage with Bloom Cores to marked enemies will trigger
      '**Tri-Karma Purification**' on all marked enemies, dealing single target
      Dendro DMG which scales off both ATK and Elemental Mastery. Tri-Karma
      Purification can be triggered every 2.5 seconds and applies 1.5U Dendro to
      enemies with no ICD. This will also generally apply as an aura in a lot of
      cases due to being procced after a reaction takes place. Three particles
      are generated from Tri-Karma Purification when it procs and can happen
      once every 8 seconds.


      Nahida’s Elemental Burst creates a very large AoE field and grants buffs
      to Nahida’s Tri-Karma Purification and the Burst itself depending on the
      current elements in the party. Pyro party members grant Tri-Karma
      Purification extra DMG%, Electro party members shorten the time between
      Tri-Karma Purification procs and Hydro party members increase the duration
      of her Elemental Burst. This Elemental Burst is a 50 cost Burst with a
      13.5s CD and 15s duration, allowing for 100% uptime if needed. 


      Nahida’s A1 passive grants up to 250 Elemental Mastery to the on-field
      character inside of her Burst based on 25% of the Elemental Mastery of the
      party member with the highest Elemental Mastery. This can be a sizable
      buff to characters who appreciate EM and also affects Nahida’s A4 as well.


      Nahida’s A4 passive gives her Tri-Karma Purification bonus DMG% and Crit
      Rate based on the amount of EM she has that exceeds above 200 EM, maxing
      out at 80% DMG bonus and 24% Crit Rate. A very nice amount of stats to her
      main damage source, which emphasizes building EM on Nahida."
