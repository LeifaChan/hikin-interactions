- title: __ER REQUIREMENT__
  description: "Every time a Projection Attack is unleashed, Alhaitham creates one
    Dendro particle, which can occur once every 1.6s (in practice, this interval is
    a bit higher). In other words, Alhaitham must take field time to generate Energy.
    He can be expected to generate 5-6 particles every rotation. \n\nWith a 70 Energy
    Cost, Bursting every rotation with Alhaitham can be challenging. Bursting every
    other rotation is fortunately a viable playstyle—in that case, Alhaitham’s ER
    requirement is usually only 100%. Otherwise, it is rarely viable to Burst every
    rotation without building some ER."
