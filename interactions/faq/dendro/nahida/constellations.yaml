      *Due to Nahida being played both on and off-field as well as having high
      or low reaction ownership depending on the team composition, the value of
      each constellation can vary drastically. DPS increases assume a
      reactionless, off-field Nahida.*

  - title: '**C1**'
    description: >-
      A nice QoL constellation, providing one level of each Elemental Burst buff
      without needing specific teammates and has a good chance of adding another
      Tri-Karma Purification proc due to Electro reducing the cooldown between
      procs as well as the Hydro effect increasing Burst uptime. This can lead
      to a longer burst duration, more damage and Dendro application. Also adds
      25% DMG to her skill, assuming there is no Pyro character. Mileage depends
      on teams, whether you can get another Tri-Karma Purification proc or not,
      and whether or not Nahida's Elemental Burst is activated every rotation.

      **DPS increase: ~5-29%**

  - title: '**C2**'
    description: >-
      An outstanding constellation. It is a straight-up 16-20% DPS increase to
      not only Nahida but the entire team, given they utilize Dendro reactions.
      It is roughly equivalent or stronger than giving every party member their
      BiS 5* weapon thus, making Nahida an even more exceptional support for
      practically every team that wants a Dendro character. 
      

      **Rating : (5/5)**


      **DPS increase: ~18% in Quicken teams, ~14-16% in Bloom teams**


      **DPS increase over C0: 5-29%**

      *(The effect of C2 is not included in this figure because the assumption is
      a reactionless Nahida)*

  - title: '**C3**'
    description: >-
      +3 talent levels to Elemental Skill. Given that most of Nahida's damage
      comes from her Elemental Skill, C3 is a fairly good buff to her DPS
      output, although nothing spectacular. However, on teams where Nahida
      triggers Spread or Blooms, MVs aren't as important and the value of C3
      diminishes. Still, it is a decent constellation. 
      
      
      **Rating : (3/5)**


      **DPS increase: ~17%** (Less valuable in both Spread and Bloom teams, especially the latter).


      **DPS increase over C0: 51%**

  - title: '**C4**'
    description: >-
      Grants a sizable amount of EM for Nahida, a stat she greatly appreciates
      for both offense and support. This constellation makes it easier for
      Nahida to reach the 1000 EM benchmark, or allows her to drop some EM
      mainstats/substats for better stats such as CRIT or a DMG% goblet. 
      

      **Rating : (3.5/5)**


      **DPS increase: ~8-16%** (Slightly more valuable in Spread teams, and less valuable in Bloom teams where Nahida has some ownership).


      **DPS increase over C0: 69%**

  - title: '**C5**'
    description: >-
      +3 talent levels to Elemental Burst. Levels on Nahida's Burst are not
      particularly impressive: the extra DMG% bonus is quite small, and the CD
      reduction and Burst extension are also rather minor. It is unlikely to
      grant another Tri-Karma Purification proc, but in certain scenarios it may
      give you the push needed.


      **Rating: (2/5)**


      **DPS increase: 1-15%** (15% is very optimistic)


      **DPS increase over C0: 72%**

  - title: '**C6**'
    description: >-
      Like most C6s in the game, Nahida's final constellation is a remarkable
      one. It gives her a frontloaded AoE nuke after using her Burst when she
      attacks marked enemies and can be triggered up to 6 times, significantly
      boosting her damage at the cost of field time. While it is an absurd
      constellation for her personal damage, Nahida is usually not the one doing
      majority of her team's damage, so the actual team DPS increase is not
      stellar, especially as she is taking field time to properly utilize this
      constellation. Hence, it is crucial to form teams around Nahida and even
      change her entire playstyle in order for her C6 to truly shine. 


      **Rating: (4.5/5)**


      **DPS increase: ~77%**


      **DPS increase over C0: 204%**

      *Note that while this seems like a massive % increase, since Nahida takes
      field time and you may be playing her in a Bloom or Spread team, the
      actual % increase is actually lower.*
