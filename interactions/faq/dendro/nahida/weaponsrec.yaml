      *Due to Nahida being played both on and off-field as well as having high
      or low reaction ownership depending on the team composition, weapon
      rankings can vary drastically. Because of this, recommended weapons will
      be options which performed well across all scenarios. Please see the full
      weapon calcs for specifics.*

      A Thousand Floating Dreams
    description: >-
      Nahida’s BiS weapon, providing 265 EM base as well as extra EM/DMG% to
      Nahida depending on the elements of her party members. Generally will be
      given a 30% DMG Bonus due to her being played as solo Dendro in a lot of
      teams. On top of that, it also grants 40 EM to other party members, a
      small but nice unconditional buff for the rest of the team.

  - title: Kagura’s Verity
    description: >-
      Another 5* weapon option which synergises with Nahida very well, providing
      66.2% CDMG as well as Elemental Skill DMG and DMG Bonus. Her short
      Elemental Skill cooldown allows for her to stack it quite easily when
      played on-field but even with one stack performs very well. However, due
      to the substat being CDMG%, you may need to run an EM Goblet / Circlet to
      make up for the lack of an EM substat.

  - title: The Widsith
    description: >-
      An amazing 4* option for Nahida, providing 55.1% CDMG as well as a large
      random buff for a short amount of time. Contrasting Kagura’s, Widsith
      excels when being able to kill enemies in one rotation and lowers in value
      for extended rotations due to the long cooldown on its buff but again,
      still performs well overall.

  - title: Solar Pearl
    description: >-
      The battle pass exclusive Catalyst, providing 27.6% CR and an Elemental
      Skill and NA DMG% buff. This weapon buffs all sources of Nahida’s damage,
      even beating out 5* options in some on-field situations due to the short
      but easily refreshable duration on its buff. If you have this weapon,
      especially at high refines, it’s worth considering but don’t feel
      pressured to buy the battle pass just for this weapon.

  - title: Wandering Evenstar
    description: >-
      The new Catalyst option on the current weapon banner, providing 165 EM and
      a flat ATK buff based on EM to Nahida and 30% of that to her teammates.
      The buff given to teammates is around 50-75 ATK at R1 and around 100-150
      ATK at R5. Due to Nahida wanting to build EM by default, this weapon is a
      good all-rounder option for both her personal and team damage, if you have
      it. Similarly to Solar Pearl, this weapon has only just released so don’t
      feel pressured to pull on the weapon banner right now just for a chance at
      getting it.

  - title: Sacrificial Fragments
    description: >-
      Another 4* option with a high 221 EM substat, which Nahida likes. The
      extra Dendro application from another Skill cast can be valuable for
      damage in comps where she has reaction ownership but generally won’t be
      too useful at low refines due to the small proc chance and long cooldown.
      Either way, just being a large EM stat stick is good.

  - title: Magic Guide
    description: >-
      Surprisingly, a really good option for Nahida, providing 187 EM as well as
      DMG% to opponents affected by Hydro or Electro. Due to her EM scalings on
      her Elemental Skill and ATK subs being less valuable, the base ATK doesn’t
      affect her too much and can even beat out 4* and 5* weapon options in
      certain scenarios. Refines are also easy to get due to it being a 3*
      weapon. Overall, an amazing F2P option considering its rarity.
