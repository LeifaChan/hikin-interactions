    While most of Tighnari’s damage comes from the EM scaling Spread reaction,
    the ATK scaling of his multipliers is still important for his overall
    damage. Prioritize leveling the AA for the Charge Attack and the Q,
    whereas the E can be prioritized last as the initial hit is only one
    moderate instance of damage. Due to Tighnari’s reliance on Spread
    reaction, getting him to Level 90 is highly advisable more so than
    crowning his talents.
