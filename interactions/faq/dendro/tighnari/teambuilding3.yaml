      __Some Recommended Teams__


      1. Double Electro Quicken: Tighnari, Fischl, Electro Flex, Defensive
      Flex  
    description: >-
      Tighnari’s best team due to full uptime on Quicken. Two electro units for
      max synergy have the best synergy with a defensive VV support. As an
      enabler carry, 2 Electro teams with VV will generally outperform 2 Dendro
      2 Electro teams with the current roster of Dendro units. In these teams,
      the electro units will typically have a higher damage contribution than
      Tighnari, and Tighnari will want to use the Deepwood Memories 4-PC set.
      Best units for the second Electro are Yae, Keqing, or Lisa, as all of them
      can swap on to use their Skill/Burst, and get more Fischl A4 procs with
      their own Aggravates before swapping off.

      2. Double Dendro Quicken:  Tighnari, Dendro Flex, Electro Flex,
      Defensive Flex

    description: >-
      A Dendro flex support instead of electro can trigger Dendro resonance,
      resulting in more EM and personal damage for Tighnari. A second Dendro
      unit will be able to hold the Deepwood Memories 4-PC set to shred Dendro
      RES while also lowering Tighnari’s ER requirements, making this the best
      team to maximize Tighnari’s personal damage. Keep in mind that because our
      off field Electro DPS units have considerably more damage output than
      Collei/DMC do, this team will likely perform worse than the Double Electro
      version until we get off field Dendro units with more DPS or utility. If
      using Fischl, the off field Dendro unit may reapply quicken instead of
      Tighnari and prevent you from getting some Fischl A4 procs.

      3. Hyperquick: Tighnari, Kokomi, Fischl, Anemo Flex

    description: >-
      A team that uses Kokomi’s slow off-field Hydro application to generate
      some seeds without removing Quicken while Tighnari is on field. These
      seeds are then triggered for Hyperbloom by either Fischl or through
      Electro Swirls from the Anemo flex unit. It is recommended to put Kokomi
      on the Deepwood Memories 4-PC set to shred Dendro RES to increase
      Hyperbloom damage, while Tighnari can use Gilded Dreams 4-PC.

      4. Geo Quicken: Tighnari, Fischl, Albedo, Zhongli
      
    description: >-
      A comfortable Quicken team that may be useful if you want Tighnari to stay
      on field for longer, but will have a lower damage ceiling than other
      options.

      5. Raiden Replaces Her Fox: Tighnari, Raiden, Kuki Shinobu,
      Kazuha/Sucrose
      
    description: >-
      A Quicken Dual Carry team that will likely be functional, but Raiden may
      prefer to be paired with more synergistic Dendro units (with higher energy
      cost/ER reqs) that aren’t in the game yet, or may prefer to use her normal
      Bennett focused teams.

      6. Refrigerated Fox: Tighnari, Kokomi, Cryo Flex, Anemo Flex
    description: >-
      A bloom team that uses Freeze co-existing with Dendro Aura to allow Kokomi
      to generate more Blooms per Dendro application (see Fridge mechanic in
      Dendro-TC chat). Kokomi should be built full EM here as she will be the
      Bloom/Rupture trigger, while Tighnari can use 4-PC Deepwood Memories to
      amplify the Bloom damage. The Cryo unit can be any off-field Cryo applier
      (Rosaria/Ganyu are recommended). The Anemo unit can group seeds and
      enemies together for more focused AoE. A more gimmick oriented team that
      does not utilize Tighnari’s DPS output the fullest due to no Spread, and
      other Dendro options with more AoE Dendro application may feel more
      consistent in this team, but it should still be bare-bones viable.
