      ***How is Tighnari’s Power Level? Is he worth pulling for on his banner or
      waiting until I lose 50/50 on future standard banners?***
    description: >-
      Despite being banished to standard banner in 3.1, Tighnari’s pre-release
      viability is looking to be well-balanced and comparable to average new 5
      star releases, and he looks to be easily better than most of the current
      standard banner units. He will have a powerful role in enabling the
      powerful off field Electro units, and the DPS potential of most Quicken
      teams is looking to be in the range of better meta teams. In terms of
      power level, Tighnari seems a bit similar to Ayato or Yoimiya on paper due
      to having similar damage contribution per field time requirement while
      also enabling powerful off field DPS units.


      However, there are some potential drawbacks to Tighnari that you may wish
      to consider before pulling for him. While Quicken teams are very powerful,
      Tighnari works well in them mainly because his personal damage is higher
      than what Collei/DMC can provide (and while Tighnari has more personal
      damage, it is mostly single target while the others excel at AoE Dendro
      application). Because of this, it is not certain whether Tighnari will be
      the best Dendro unit for Quicken teams as more Dendro and Electro units
      come out. 


      For example, if we get a powerful off field Dendro DPS or EM buffer, or a
      Dendro healer, Tighnari may become less valuable in future 1 Dendro/2
      Electro/1 Anemo Quicken teams (though such a unit could make 2 Dendro
      Quicken teams with Tighnari much more viable). An on field Dendro unit
      that uses normal attacks may have better synergy with Fischl for C6 procs,
      as well as with Beidou. Additionally, if we get an on field EM scaling
      Electro unit designed to take advantage of Aggravate in the near future,
      it is very likely that such a unit will want to use Fischl (to drive
      Fischl A4 procs more effectively than Tighnari can) and may prefer a unit
      with off field/AoE Dendro application rather than using Tighnari as an
      enabler. So while Tighnari may be meta for Quicken teams during 3.0, he
      may become overshadowed for these teams later on as more units designed
      around Dendro reactions are released. Despite this, Tighnari should still
      retain a powerful and flexible niche in these teams as a Quickswap enabler
      of Quicken related teams.


      Because Tighnari will be added to the standard banner in 3.1, those that
      pull for Tighnari in 3.0 may get better long term value from investing in
      him if they get his constellations gradually over time from losing 50/50s.
      While Tighnari’s early constellations aren’t very useful, his C4 and C6
      are powerful and may help him retain meta relevance over future C0 Dendro
      units that are only available on limited banners. Of course, given the RNG
      of getting specific standard banner units it may take years to get
      Tighnari’s higher end constellations. Those who want Tighnari but may want
      to wait to get him on standard banner should consider getting him on his
      limited banner in 3.0 due to the low odds of getting him over other
      standard banner characters. Additionally, he may not have another rate up
      banner after 3.0, so it's possible if you miss him now, it may take you
      years to get him, if ever at all. Those who pull on limited banners will
      need to pull a 50/50 pity 8 times to have had a roughly 50% chance of
      pulling at least one Tighnari. So if you really like Tighnari, I would
      suggest pulling for him in 3.0 and hopefully watch him get stronger over
      the years from gradually getting constellations from lost 50/50s.
