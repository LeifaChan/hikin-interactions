    Signature Weapon - Hunter's Path
  description: >-

    His 5★ Signature Bow Hunter’s Path stands tall above all other
    options. At R1, it is a massive 25-30% upgrade over his best R5 4★ options
    and even gains significant mileage over other 5★ Bows. Additionally,
    should Tighnari not burst every DPS cycle, the advantage of Hunter’s Path
    increases even further.

    Should one look to invest more Primogems into their Tighnari his signature
    weapon is most definitely your first stop and takes priority over his
    Constellations.

    3★ Option

    R5 Slingshot
  description: >-

    "The general recommendation if you don't have a 5* weapon available for 
    Tighnari is not even a 4* weapon, but a 3* weapon: R5 Slingshot!

    As so much of Tighnari’s DMG comes from Spread Reactions, its low Base ATK
    is not as much of a detriment. Its passive +60% works pretty effortlessly
    on his initial CA Hit and makes more than up for the -10% the Clusters
    afterwards receive. Combined with its high CR Substat, it becomes an
    excellent choice competing with R5 4* options."

    "Otherwise, **if one insists on using a 4* weapon**, a lot of high
    refinement ones are comparable to Slingshot if you can satisfy their
    accompanying conditions. None of them however really stand notably above
    Slingshot for general use.

    **all 3 Craftables** are fairly close to each other, but all come with
    their individual requirements. None of them really excel over Slingshot
    consistently enough to warrant spending the 5 Billets on them.

    The Stringless
    
  description: >-

    The Stringless can be a fine option if you burst every DPS cycle, but
    doesn’t stand out and an accompanying Fischl would love to have it much
    more.

  description: >-

    Windblume Ode is just a worse Stringless for the most part and falls
    behind Slingshot, so sadly it stays all dusty and rusty.

    Fading Twilight can be solid if its ER Substat is put to good use.

- title: Alley Hunter

  description: >-

    Alley Hunter at high refinements stands out as Tighnari’s best non-5*
    weapon IF you execute Tighnari’s DPS cycles cleanly within 4s and thus
    prevent its Stack decay. Not suitable for extended field-time and quite
    inaccessible being a limited 4* Weapon.
