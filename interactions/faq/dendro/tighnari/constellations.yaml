    description: >-
      **C1**- Gives 15% CRIT Rate % to Tighnari’s Charge Attacks. Overall an
      alright constellation since the CRIT will scale up Spread damage from CAs,
      and it allows you to reinvest 1 CRIT Rate % substat into EM so you don’t
      overcap CRIT Rate on CAs. Free CRIT Rate is always nice, but the fact that
      the Q is not boosted by the extra Crit Rate holds this constellation back
      a bit. Would not recommend that Dolphins specifically go for it. Rating:
      2/5. 


      **C2**- Provides 20% Dendro DMG bonus to Tighnari when an enemy is in his
      E’s taunt field. A nice boost to his damage given that external Dendro DMG
      bonus % buffs will be rare in the game for now. May be unreliable if 1
      enemy dies in the E’s taunt field and the rest of your damage goes to
      enemies outside of the taunt field. Rating: 2/5. 


      **C3**- Tighnari gains much less from his ATK scaling multipliers relative
      to his EM scaling Spread damage (or compared to CRIT and DMG bonus that
      can affect both forms of damage), meaning this constellation is very
      insignificant. Rating: 1/5.


      **C4**-  Tighnari’s Q gives a 60 EM buff for 8 seconds to all party
      members including himself. If the Q triggers a Dendro related reaction,
      the buff is refreshed with an additional 60 EM, to buff allies for up to
      120 EM. While this constellation only gives Tighnari around an 14% DPS
      increase, being able to buff EM for the entire team can net high teamwide
      DPS gains for Tighnari’s Electro DPS units, making it easily his most
      impactful constellation for teamwide damage. Rating: 3.5/5


      **C5**- Tighnari gains much less from his ATK scaling multipliers relative
      to his EM scaling Spread damage (or compared to CRIT and DMG bonus that
      can affect both forms of damage), meaning this constellation is very
      insignificant. Rating: 1/5.


      **C6**-  Tighnari’s level 2 Charge Attack’s charge time is reduced by .9
      seconds, and provides an extra Clusterbloom arrow that deals an additional
      150% ATK scaling damage. This constellation is great QOL and allows him to
      bypass the ICD on Dendro application. Rating: 4/5.
