      __Electro Units for Quicken Teams__

      __Fischl__

    description: >-
      
      Likely one of Tighnari’s best teammates, Fischl is looking to
      be the premier off field DPS in all Quicken teams due to her A4 triggering
      when the on field unit triggers Quicken or Aggravate. While on field
      Dendro units cannot trigger Fischl’s A4 with Spread, reapplying Quicken
      will allow them to trigger Fischl’s A4 regardless to get additional
      Aggravate procs from Fischl. Because of this and her excellent energy
      generation, Fischl is looking to be nigh irreplaceable in Tighnari’s main
      teams.

  - title: __Yae__
    description: >-
      Another powerful off field Electro unit, Yae looks to be strong
      in Quicken focused teams. Her A4 talent incentivizes building EM on her,
      which allows her to slot into Quicken teams better than most would expect.
      Her long field time requirements work well with Tighnari’s short field
      time requirements and Yae also has high synergy with Fischl as well. Yae
      can provide extra Fischl A4 procs with her Elemental Burst while she’s on
      field, and Yae appreciates the energy from Fischl.

  - title: __Lisa__
    description: >-
      While an often overlooked unit, Lisa could have strong potential
      in Quicken teams through the use of her Q for off field Electro
      application. Lisa gains EM from ascension, boosting her own Aggravate
      damage, and her DEF Shredwill also be a sizable teamwide damage boost.
      While usually a TTDS slave, Lisa here can be built more offensively with
      weapons like Widsith, or more supportively with Hakushin Ring. She will
      need a fair amount of ER and Fischl in order to use her Q as frequently as
      possible. Her C4 gives her a huge boost in multi-target scenarios.

  - title: __Keqing__
    description: >-
      A decent partner for Tighnari in dual carry or quickswap
      setups. Tighnari only needs 4 seconds of field time for every 12 second
      rotation, which Keqing can slot nicely into, while providing more A4 procs
      for Fischl.

  - title: __Beidou__
    description: >-
      Beidou Not recommended but could work, Tighnari doesn’t seem to be a
      strong driver for Beidou.

  - title: __Raiden__
    description: >-
      Works fairly well with Tighnari in a dual carry setup as
      Tighnari will be able to maintain Quicken for most of Raiden’s Burst
      uptime, but the two units don’t have much synergy in terms of
      energy/resolve gain. Potentially fun for overworld where Raiden’s E will
      allow Tighnari to use Quicken when sniping from far outside of Fischl and
      Yae’s range.

      __Dendro Units for Quicken Teams__

      __Devil May Cry (DMC)__


    description: >-
      A decent option for Dendro Resonance and EM
      buffs, but has lower personal damage compared to using a second Electro
      unit. Can hold Freedom Sworn if you have it. Can hold Deepwood Memories
      4-PC to shred Dendro RES.

      __Collei__
    description: >-
      A decent option for Dendro Resonance and EM buffs at C4 (or
      with Elegy), but has lower personal damage compared to using a second
      Electro unit. Can hold Deepwood Memories 4-PC to shred Dendro RES.
