      __Electro Units for Quicken Teams__

      __Fischl__

    description: >-
      
      Likely one of Tighnari’s best teammates, Fischl is looking to
      be the premier off field DPS in all Quicken teams due to her A4 triggering
      when the on field unit triggers Quicken or Aggravate. While on field
      Dendro units cannot trigger Fischl’s A4 with Spread, reapplying Quicken
      will allow them to trigger Fischl’s A4 regardless to get additional
      Aggravate procs from Fischl. Because of this and her excellent energy
      generation, Fischl is looking to be nigh irreplaceable in Tighnari’s main
      teams.

  - title: Yae
    description: >-
      Another powerful off field Electro unit, Yae looks to be strong
      in Quicken focused teams. Her A4 talent incentivizes building EM on her,
      which allows her to slot into Quicken teams better than most would expect.
      Her long field time requirements work well with Tighnari’s short field
      time requirements and Yae also has high synergy with Fischl as well. Yae
      can provide extra Fischl A4 procs with her Elemental Burst while she’s on
      field, and Yae appreciates the energy from Fischl.

  - title: Lisa
    description: >-
      While an often overlooked unit, Lisa could have strong potential
      in Quicken teams through the use of her Q for off field Electro
      application. Lisa gains EM from ascension, boosting her own Aggravate
      damage, and her DEF Shredwill also be a sizable teamwide damage boost.
      While usually a TTDS slave, Lisa here can be built more offensively with
      weapons like Widsith, or more supportively with Hakushin Ring. She will
      need a fair amount of ER and Fischl in order to use her Q as frequently as
      possible. Her C4 gives her a huge boost in multi-target scenarios.

  - title: Kequing
    description: >-
      A decent partner for Tighnari in dual carry or quickswap
      setups. Tighnari only needs 4 seconds of field time for every 12 second
      rotation, which Keqing can slot nicely into, while providing more A4 procs
      for Fischl.

    description: >-
      Beidou Not recommended but could work, Tighnari doesn’t seem to be a
      strong driver for Beidou.

  - title: Raiden
    description: >-
      Works fairly well with Tighnari in a dual carry setup as
      Tighnari will be able to maintain Quicken for most of Raiden’s Burst
      uptime, but the two units don’t have much synergy in terms of
      energy/resolve gain. Potentially fun for overworld where Raiden’s E will
      allow Tighnari to use Quicken when sniping from far outside of Fischl and
      Yae’s range.

      __Dendro Units for Quicken Teams__

      __Devil May Cry (DMC)__


    description: >-
      A decent option for Dendro Resonance and EM
      buffs, but has lower personal damage compared to using a second Electro
      unit. Can hold Freedom Sworn if you have it. Can hold Deepwood Memories
      4-PC to shred Dendro RES.

      __Collei__
    description: >-
      A decent option for Dendro Resonance and EM buffs at C4 (or
      with Elegy), but has lower personal damage compared to using a second
      Electro unit. Can hold Deepwood Memories 4-PC to shred Dendro RES.

      Defensive Options
      
      Healer Sucrose

    description: >-
      With Prototype Amber and VV, Sucrose is the best
      healer for overall damage potential for Quicken teams with 2 Electro
      units, and outperforms Jean for personal and team damage output at the
      expense of comfort. Prototype Amber also lowers her ER requirements a bit.

      __Jean/Sayu__
    description: >-
      Anemo healer with VV for double Electro teams, but lack of
      EM or DMG % buffs hold them back relative to other Anemo units.

      __Zhongli__
    description: >-
      The Jade Shield isn’t super necessary on Tighnari due to the
      fast charge time of his E and his taunt, but he can still be useful for
      more difficult content. He only applies -20% Electro and Dendro RES shred
      via his shield, and has no real damage contribution besides that. He could
      run Archaic Petra to buff Electro DMG%, or Deepwood Memories set to shred
      Dendro RES further, but even then Zhongli will tend to lower the team’s
      DPS potential.

  - title: >-
      __Kokomi__
    description: >-
      Enables various Bloom-related teams while being a powerful
      healer, and her slow off field Hydro application can let her generate some
      seeds without removing Quicken during Tighnari’s DPS window. Can run
      utility weapons such as TTDS and supportive artifacts such as Tenacity of
      the Milleleth 4-PC or Deepwood Memories 4-PC to help buff her teams.

  - title: >-
      __Diona__
    description: >-
      Shielder with an EM buff at C6. Doesn’t fit nicely into
      Tighnari rotations, and Cryo will not interfere with Quicken due to Cryo
      and Dendro auras not reacting, but is still usable.

      __Kuki Shinobu/Dori__
    description: >-
      Alright options for Electro and healing, though
      their Electro application is low, so don’t expect a lot of Aggravate
      procs. Kuki may work well in Hyperbloom setups as a reliable Electro
      trigger for the reaction and can buff teammates with ToM (most relevant
      for Raiden dual carry, which wants as much ATK as possible), but may feel
      compromising to play with Tighnari in somewhat close range.

      __Miscellaneous__

      __Other Anemo Supports__
    description: >-
      Double Electro teams may especially appreciate
      Sucrose, Kazuha or Venti to provide VV, grouping, Electro DMG% buffs, or
      EM buffs. Anemo infusions with Electro, as well as Electro Swirl in AoE
      will also net you more Aggravates. Bloom seeds are also suckable by CC
      abilities.

      __Ayato__

      A possible option to apply Hydro off-field for Hyperbloom teams
      with Kuki Shinobu.

      __Albedo__
    description: >-
      Albedo A random flex option that has off field damage and buffs EM.
      Could work with Zhongli in Geo Resonance comfort teams.

      __Rosaria/Ganyu/Kaeya__
    description: >-
      An option for the gimmicky but likely viable Fridge teams, where Dendro 
      aura+Freeze increases the amount of Hydro needed to completely eat the 
      Dendro aura, allowing Hydro units to generate more Blooms.
