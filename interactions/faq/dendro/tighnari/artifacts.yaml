      Tighnari has multiple Artifact Sets suiting him. Namely, Deepwood
      Memories, Gilded Dreams and Wanderer’s Troupe.

  - title: Deepwood Memories
    description: >-
      Deepwood Memories is a special case, since it's the Viridescent
      Venerer equivalent for Dendro, providing Dendro RES Shred. Ideally for
      Tighnari, someone else on his team would wear this set to provide the RES
      Shred for him. However, should no suitable or worthwhile wearer be on
      Tighnari’s team it is his best option to maximize his own damage by a
      respectable margin.

  - title: Gilded Dreams/Wanderer's Troupe
    description: >-
      In case Deepwood is covered by someone else, Tighnari’s best options are
      Gilded Dreams and Wanderer’s Troupe. The difference between these
      2 sets is fairly small and which one comes out on top depends on the
      specific setup used. Wanderer’s Troupe ends up favored with external EM
      Buffs, Constellations or if Tighnari’s Burst is not used in every DPS
      cycle.

      Whereas Gilded Dreams is favored if Tighnari is EM starved due to a lack
      of buffs or running a non-EM Sands. Getting significant DMG% buffs would
      also favor Gilded Dreams, however there are next to no Dendro DMG% buffs
      in the game in 3.0.


      Generally Wanderer’s Troupe is easier to recommend as long-time players
      will undoubtedly already have strong pieces of it and it is also available
      as a Strongbox, making it difficult to obtain a brand new Gilded Dreams
      set good enough to match or beat a pre-existing Wanderer’s Troupe set.

      However, since Deepwood Memories is in the same Artifact Domain and
      Tighnari players will want a functional set in any case, players may still
      end up with a competent Gilded Dreams Set on the side regardless.

  - title: Mixed Sets
    description: >-
      Mixed Sets are generally a bit behind, but follow the priority of
      2Deepwood (15% Dendro Dmg) > 2EM/ER > 2ATK >= 2NO. With 2ER only being
      valuable if Tighnari can use it to meet his ER requirements.

      Trap Sets

      Shimenawa's Reminiscence and Thundersoother
    description: >-
      Shimenawa might appear attractive at first due to Tighnari’s emphasis
      on CAs and his low energy cost. However the set would significantly
      increase Tighnari’s ER requirements under normal circumstances as his
      Burst is still important. And even if you manage to cheat your way around
      that you have to make sure that Tighnari gains enough energy after casting
      his Skill so that he can burst timely after doing his CAs, creating
      practical issues and removing a lot of flexibility from his rotations.


      Thundersoother cannot reach a good uptime as Tighnari himself will
      constantly remove Electro by applying Dendro and refreshing Quicken.
