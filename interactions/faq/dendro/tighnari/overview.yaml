    - title: __DISCLAIMER (This one is especially important)__
      description: >-
        Dendro is a new element and there are many things we still do not know about
        the new elemental reactions. Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually
        subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these
        are theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith
        analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we
        know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with
        everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of
        salt.

      description: >-
        Tighnari is a 5 star Dendro bow unit and is the first Dendro 5 star to be
        released in Genshin Impact. Because Dendro is new and has not been
        thoroughly tested, please take our work with an extra dose of salt, as we
        may learn a lot more about Dendro teams in the future after testing.


        Tighnari is an on field DPS unit that has a very short (4 second) field
        time requirement for each rotation. His kit seems designed around the
        Quicken reaction, and Spread makes up around 40-50% of his total damage
        output in these teams. Because of this, Tighnari will likely have a role
        in enabling Electro units, especially Fischl and Yae Miko, but he may have
        some viability in other Dendro reaction focused teams as well. His short
        field time requirement makes him a good choice for Quickswap oriented
        teams as well.


        Tighnari’s playstyle is based around his Charge Attack, which has a
        2-stage charge, akin to Ganyu, but the charge time is longer than hers at
        nearly 3 seconds for the level 2 charge. The level 2 Charge Attack has 5
        instances of Dendro DMG, an initial hit, and 4 Clusterbloom Arrows that
        branch off and home in on the enemy. The Clusterbloom Arrows are
        technically AoE, but have a very small hitbox, meaning most of the time 1
        enemy will be hit (upon release we will test how close or grouped enemies
        will have to be for any AoE). Each level 2 Charge Attack at C0 applies
        Dendro twice.


        Tighnari’s E grants him 3 orbs which reduce the charge time of each level
        2 Charge Attack to .5 seconds, making him very fluid for a Charge Attack
        Bow unit. The orbs granted by his E will persist when he swaps out. The E
        also creates a taunt field that makes nearby enemies attack each other,
        which helps him avoid interruption during his short field time window. The
        E is also Tighnari’s best source of AoE Dendro application. Tighnari’s E
        grants 3.5 particles per cast, making his energy generation quite good,
        though he will still need some ER% to use his Q every 12 seconds.


        Tighnari’s Q is a 40 cost multi-hit nuke that nets him a lot of Spread
        procs when combined with his CAs. Tighnari’s ascension passives grant him
        50 extra EM when he uses a level 2 Charge Attack, and gives EM to DMG
        Bonus conversion for his CA and Q, which incentivize Tighnari to build EM
        to capitalize on the Spread reaction, which scales off of EM, Dendro DMG%
        Bonus and CRIT stats. Every hit of the Q targets a single enemy, and
        Tighnari has a generally single target ranged niche as a whole.
