- title: '***ENERGY REQUIREMENT***'
  description: >-
    Despite Tighnariâ€™s primary home being Quicken Teams his Energy
    requirements can vary a lot depending on the exact Team and Rotation.


    The 2 most important factors are the number of Dendro units on the Team
    and if Tighnari wants to use his Burst every DPS cycle (12-15s) or only
    every other DPS Cycle (24-30s).


    In Double Dendro Teams, his ER requirements are usually **120-140%** if he
    wants to burst every DPS cycle. Whereas in Double Electro Teams his ER
    requirements are usually around **160-180%** if he wants to burst every
    DPS cycle.

    Teams with neither a second Dendro unit nor Electro Resonance may feature
    even higher ER requirements and it is not recommended to burst every DPS
    cycle in such Teams.


    Should you opt to burst every other DPS cycle, his ER requirements are
    generally **non-existent**. 


    Notably, since Tighnari thrives in a flexible quickswap environment a
    possible approach is to mostly forego ER in high ER demanding Teams and
    simply use his Burst whenever possible and either let him do an additional
    slow CA or let someone else fill the field time should not enough
    particles drop to fill his Burst for a given DPS cycle.
