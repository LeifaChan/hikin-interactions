      Healer Sucrose

    description: >-
      With Prototype Amber and VV, Sucrose is the best
      healer for overall damage potential for Quicken teams with 2 Electro
      units, and outperforms Jean for personal and team damage output at the
      expense of comfort. Prototype Amber also lowers her ER requirements a bit.

      __Jean/Sayu__
    description: >-
      Anemo healer with VV for double Electro teams, but lack of
      EM or DMG % buffs hold them back relative to other Anemo units.

      __Zhongli__
    description: >-
      The Jade Shield isn’t super necessary on Tighnari due to the
      fast charge time of his E and his taunt, but he can still be useful for
      more difficult content. He only applies -20% Electro and Dendro RES shred
      via his shield, and has no real damage contribution besides that. He could
      run Archaic Petra to buff Electro DMG%, or Deepwood Memories set to shred
      Dendro RES further, but even then Zhongli will tend to lower the team’s
      DPS potential.

      __Kokomi__
    description: >-
      Enables various Bloom-related teams while being a powerful
      healer, and her slow off field Hydro application can let her generate some
      seeds without removing Quicken during Tighnari’s DPS window. Can run
      utility weapons such as TTDS and supportive artifacts such as Tenacity of
      the Milleleth 4-PC or Deepwood Memories 4-PC to help buff her teams.

      __Diona__
    description: >-
      Shielder with an EM buff at C6. Doesn’t fit nicely into
      Tighnari rotations, and Cryo will not interfere with Quicken due to Cryo
      and Dendro auras not reacting, but is still usable.

      __Kuki Shinobu/Dori__
    description: >-
      Alright options for Electro and healing, though
      their Electro application is low, so don’t expect a lot of Aggravate
      procs. Kuki may work well in Hyperbloom setups as a reliable Electro
      trigger for the reaction and can buff teammates with ToM (most relevant
      for Raiden dual carry, which wants as much ATK as possible), but may feel
      compromising to play with Tighnari in somewhat close range.

      __Miscellaneous__

      __Other Anemo Supports__
    description: >-
      Double Electro teams may especially appreciate
      Sucrose, Kazuha or Venti to provide VV, grouping, Electro DMG% buffs, or
      EM buffs. Anemo infusions with Electro, as well as Electro Swirl in AoE
      will also net you more Aggravates. Bloom seeds are also suckable by CC
      abilities.

      with Kuki Shinobu.

      __Albedo__
    description: >-
      Albedo A random flex option that has off field damage and buffs EM.
      Could work with Zhongli in Geo Resonance comfort teams.

      __Rosaria/Ganyu/Kaeya__
    description: >-
      An option for the gimmicky but likely viable Fridge teams, where Dendro 
      aura+Freeze increases the amount of Hydro needed to completely eat the 
      Dendro aura, allowing Hydro units to generate more Blooms.
