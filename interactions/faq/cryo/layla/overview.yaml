- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: >-
    Layla is a Cryo 4-star sword-wielder who deals damage and creates shields
    based off of her HP stat. She requires very little on-field time to
    perform, therefore she pairs well with DPSs that require a lot of on-field
    time. Low energy requirements eliminate the need for a battery, making it
    easy to slot Layla into any team that needs her.


    HP, ER, and 30% CRIT Rate or more (to proc Favonius passive) are most
    valuable to Layla. Due to her HP scaling, the ATK stat on weapons doesn't
    matter, meaning that she will perform when equipped with anything that
    offers a good enough ability or offers HP% or ER%. She is not picky when
    it comes to weapons, generally any sword with ER% or HP% substat or boost
    in the passive could be a good option for shield support build. Her build
    can skew towards shields or damage, but no matter what gear is used on
    Layla, her shield will be decent. However, the difference in builds
    between defensive and offensive options is minimal.


    Laylaâ€™s constellations provide extra shield strength, ER requirement
    reduction, damage boosting for on-field character and more personal
    damage. C1 enhances her Shield Strength and grants all your co-op
    teammates with a shield identical in utility to your own. C2 restores
    energy with skill hits and eliminates her ER requirement , enabling her to
    build more HP. C4 provides Normal and Charged attack DMG to the character
    on-field, usually around 2k per NA or CA hit. C6 increase her overall
    damage and reduce the required time to stack up her *Shooting Stars*
