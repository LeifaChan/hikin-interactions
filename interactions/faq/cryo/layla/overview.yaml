  Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release
  (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
  Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little
  information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally,
  are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ
  should be taken with a grain of salt.

    description: >-
      Layla is a Cryo 4-star sword-wielder who deals damage and creates shields
      based off of her HP stat. She requires very little on-field time to
      perform, therefore she pairs well with DPSs that require a lot of on-field
      time. Low energy requirements eliminate the need for a battery, making it
      easy to slot Layla into any team that needs her.


      HP, ER, and 30% CRIT Rate or more (to proc Favonius passive) are most
      valuable to Layla. Due to her HP scaling, the ATK stat on weapons doesn't
      matter, meaning that she will perform when equipped with anything that
      offers a good enough ability or offers HP% or ER%. She is not picky when
      it comes to weapons, generally any sword with ER% or HP% substat or boost
      in the passive could be a good option for shield support build. Her build
      can skew towards shields or damage, but no matter what gear is used on
      Layla, her shield will be decent. However, the difference in builds
      between defensive and offensive options is minimal.


      Layla’s constellations provide extra shield strength, ER requirement
      reduction, damage boosting for on-field character and more personal
      damage. C1 enhances her Shield Strength and grants all your co-op
      teammates with a shield identical in utility to your own. C2 restores
      energy with skill hits and eliminates her ER requirement , enabling her to
      build more HP. C4 provides Normal and Charged attack DMG to the character
      on-field, usually around 2k per NA or CA hit. C6 increase her overall
      damage and reduce the required time to stack up her *Shooting Stars*
