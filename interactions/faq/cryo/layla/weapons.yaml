      Her selection of weapons can be separated into two focuses: shield support
      or  off-field DPS. And the ranking would vary since for shield support she
      would like as much HP as possible, while for off-field DPS, Crit would
      matter a lot more. The DMG gain from extra ATK is negligible, therefore
      weapons with ATK substat is not recommended. 


      **The DMG gained/Shield Absorption lost or vice versa when switching build
      direction is not significant compared to other characters. Please
      reference Layla Mastersheet for detailed comparison. **
