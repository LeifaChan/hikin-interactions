      ***Main Stats***


      Laylaâ€™s main role in a team is to provide a shield with her Skill as well
      as some off-field Cryo damage. With her shield being the main attracting
      point, the artifact main stats choices are quite straightforward.


      **Sands of Eon:** HP% or ER%


      Depending on team composition, ER% Sands can be used if you want to Burst
      off cooldown when Layla is the only Cryo character in the team. In other
      scenarios, HP% Sands is preferred to maximize her shield and damage from
      her Ascension 4.


      **Goblet of Eonothem:** HP% or Cryo DMG%


      Using a Cryo DMG% Goblet will let Layla deal 20% more damage at the cost
      of a 10% thinner shield. 


      **Circlet of Logos:** HP% or Crit


      Both HP% and Crit circlet will perform comparably, while HP% allow a
      stronger shield and Crit one is more offensive. Substats will play an
      important role here, where Crit Circlet only leads by ~10% if both
      circlets have similar amounts of useful substats.

      **Substats:** ER% (until meet requirement) > CR (for Favonius proc) > CD = HP% > Flat HP > ATK%

      __Artifact Sets__

      4PC Tenacity of the Millelith
    description: Arguably Layla's BiS Artifact Set, providing ATK% and Shield Strength% to her team with a relatively high uptime. Then 20% HP also increase her Shield Strength and Damage.

  - title: 4PC Noblesse Oblige
    description: A is comparably effective if there are better units in the team that already utilize 4-piece TotM. However Layla must have enough ER to Burst at least once every rotation to make it worth using.

  - title: 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate or 4PC Blizzard Strayer
    description: Personal damage wise, both of the options above are the best, but considering her lackluster damage output, it is better to use the supportive options above.

  - title: 4PC Instructor
    description: You can consider using this set when using her in a team utilizing amplifying reactions like Vaporize and Melt to further buff the damage. Note that when using a 4 star artifact set, shield strength will be much lower compared to 5 star options, therefore a 5 star piece (preferably Sands) is much recommended.
