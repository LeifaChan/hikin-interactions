      ***Main Stats***


      Laylaâ€™s main role in a team is to provide a shield with her Skill as well
      as some off-field Cryo damage. With her shield being the main attracting
      point, the artifact main stats choices are quite straightforward.


      **Sands of Eon:** HP% or ER%


      Depending on team composition, ER% Sands can be used if you want to Burst
      off cooldown when Layla is the only Cryo character in the team. In other
      scenarios, HP% Sands is preferred to maximize her shield and damage from
      her Ascension 4.


      **Goblet of Eonothem:** HP% or Cryo DMG%


      Using a Cryo DMG% Goblet will let Layla deal 20% more damage at the cost
      of a 10% thinner shield. 


      **Circlet of Logos:** HP% or Crit


      Both HP% and Crit circlet will perform comparably, while HP% allow a
      stronger shield and Crit one is more offensive. Substats will play an
      important role here, where Crit Circlet only leads by ~10% if both
      circlets have similar amounts of useful substats.

      With how her Elemental Skill works, her best-ins-lot artifact set is
      arguably  **4-piece Tenacity of the Millelith** (TotM), providing ATK% and
      Shield Strength% to her team with a relatively high uptime. **4-pieces
      Noblesse Oblige** is comparably effective if there are better units in the
      team that  already utilize  4-piece TotM. Personal damage wise, **4-piece
      Blizzard Strayer** and **4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate** are the best
      choices, but considering her lackluster damage output, it is best to use
      the supportive options above.


      You can consider **4-piece Instructor** when using her in a team utilizing
      amplifying reactions like Vaporize and Melt to further buff the damage.
      Note  that when using a 4 star artifact set, shield strength will be much
      lower compared to 5 star options, therefore a 5 star piece (preferably
      Sands) is much recommended.
