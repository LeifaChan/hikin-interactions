      HP scalers usually want to be level 90 to fully take advantage of the
      large amount of HP% gained through final ascension. 


      At face value her skill and burst are straight forward: her skill
      generates a Cryo shield with 250% effectiveness against cryo attacks. It
      has a 12s duration and 12s cooldown, allowing 100% uptime. Her Burst
      summons a turret that shoots homing projectiles (*Starlight Slugs*) every
      1.5s dealing DMG based on her HP. This is the majority of her personal
      DMG. 



      **Elemental Skill and Burst**


      There is more to her Skill and Burst: The *Night Stars/Shooting Stars.*
      Whenever the shield is active, stack-like marks called the Night Stars are
      generated. They can be generated three ways:


        ⦁ 1 *Night Star* is automatically generated every 1.5s

        ⦁ If the on-field character uses their elemental skill, 2 *Night Stars* are generated. This has a 0.3s cooldown.

        ⦁ When the *Starlight Slugs* from her burst hits, 1 Night Star will be generated. This has a 0.5s cooldown.


      Through these methods, whenever four stars are accumulated, all of them
      will be consumed and shot out as Shooting Stars that deal damage. Expect
      around 12 *Shooting Stars* every shield duration. This process will be
      interrupted if her shield breaks at any moment. 


      **Passive Talents**


      Her passive talents are simple. Ascension 1 gives her stack-based extra
      shield strength based on the *Night Star* generation. And Ascension 4
      grants her additive DMG onto her *Shooting Stars*. It is worth noting that
      even with this passive active, the *Shooting Stars* will still not be her
      dominant source of damage. 


      The over-world passive talent is quite nice as she gives 10% chance of
      doubling the product when crafting character talent materials.
