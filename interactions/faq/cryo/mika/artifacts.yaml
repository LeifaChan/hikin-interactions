      Mika doesn’t offer great Elemental application or damage with his
      Elemental Skill and Burst, making artifact substats and sets that focus on
      buffing or healing teammates more useful overall.

      __NOTABLE SETS__

      **4pc Noblesse Oblige:**
    description: >-
      An excellent support set in most teams. As both the *Soulwind* effect and
      4pc Noblesse Oblige’s buff last 12s, they synergize well when activated
      right before swapping into your on-field DPS.

  - title: '**4pc Scholar:**'
    description: >-
      Niche artifact set that can be used in Wanderer teams to help with Energy
      requirements, if someone (usually Bennett) already holds 4pc Noblesse.
      Artifact quality is not important, as Mika would only use his Elemental
      Skill in those teams, which doesn’t scale with stats, and his damage
      contribution is negligible.

  - title: '**4pc The Exile:**'
    description: >-
      When his Elemental Burst is needed or if the rotation length enables it,
      4pc Exile serves as a more universal choice compared to Scholar, as the
      latter only restores Energy for Bow and Catalyst users while 4pc Exile
      restores more Energy overall, and for everyone on the team besides the set
      holder.

  - title: '**4pc Ocean-Hued Clam (4OHC):**'
    description: >-
      If someone already holds a 4pc Noblesse Oblige, 4OHC provides a big burst
      of Physical DMG with the initial healing from Mika’s Burst, along with
      smaller procs after. It is worth noting that 4OHC’s damage is enhanced by
      shredding enemies’ Physical Resistance with Superconduct, but **is not**
      increased by Physical DMG% Bonuses.
