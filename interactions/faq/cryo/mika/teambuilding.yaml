      __TEAM BUILDING__

      **Eula Carry**
    description: >-
      At C6, Mika can serve as a good alternative to Bennett, since he provides
      both healing and buffs for Eula. Using C6 Mika as a buffer also means that
      Eula no longer has to worry about staying within a circle to maximize her
      damage. As Mika already provides sufficient defensive utility, using an
      offensive Cryo unit such as Rosaria or Shenhe is recommended in the third
      slot to compensate for his lack of damage. Running an Electro unit as the
      last teammate further boosts Physical DMG with Superconduct; while Mika's
      Skill cooldown is too long to buff 2 units, Raiden is still a premier
      option for this due to the Energy she generates.

  - title: '**Crescent Pike Zhongli**'
    description: >-
      While a very fun comp to play as the ATK SPD buff from Mika makes using
      Normal Attacks more appealing, this team has the opportunity cost of
      running a more beneficial support like Bennett or Yun Jin in place of
      Mika, as his buffs lack the same impact. Since Mika’s poor Cryo
      application is insufficient in maintaining Superconduct uptime, it would
      be advised to run a secondary Cryo unit along with him. Ultimately, he
      brings less to the table than other team members.

  - title: '**Wanderer**'
    description: >-
      As Catalyst characters do not have hitlag, Wanderer can make full use of
      the ATK SPD buffs Mika can offer to increase both his damage and the
      fluidity of his attacks. If Mika can apply sufficient Cryo to allow
      Wanderer to come into contact with it when using his Skill, he also
      provides a hefty 20% CRIT Rate buff due to Wanderer’s A1. However, he
      suffers stiff competition from both Layla and Rosaria in this role. Both
      offer more damage and Elemental application than Mika can muster;
      Rosaria's damage is particularly notable and she can also offer a 15% CRIT
      Rate buff from her A4, while Layla's strong shield is much more valuable
      for the interruption-prone Wanderer than Mika’s healing. As such, they are
      generally better, though Mika still serves as a fun and usable option.
