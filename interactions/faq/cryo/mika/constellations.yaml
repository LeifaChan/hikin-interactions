      __CONSTELLATIONS__

      **C1 -  Factor Confluence**
    description: >-
      > *The Soulwind state of Starfrost Swirl can decrease the healing interval
      between instances caused by Skyfeather Song's Eagleplume state. This
      decrease percentage is equal to the ATK SPD increase provided by
      Soulwind.*


      Provides a minor increase in his healing. Although the interval reduction
      is appreciated, this Constellation only improves the single-target healing
      portion of his Burst, which is not too significant. Players who struggle
      with survivability may enjoy this Constellation, though it is definitely
      not a necessity to stay alive.

      > *When Starfrost Swirl's Flowfrost Arrow first hits an opponent, or its
      Rimestar Flare hits opponents, 1 Detector stack from Passive Talent
      "Suppressive Barrage" will be generated.

      > You must have unlocked the Passive Talent "Suppressive Barrage" first.*


      Functionally gives one more Detector stack in situations with three or
      fewer enemies. Although an additional Detector stack is appreciated, the
      amount of Physical DMG a Detector stack gives is minor.

      Increases the healing from his Burst marginally, which can help players
      with comfort.

      > *When Mika's own Skyfeather Song's Eagleplume state heals party members,
      this will restore 3 Energy to Mika. This form of Energy restoration can
      occur 5 times during the Eagleplume state created by 1 use of Skyfeather
      Song.*


      Reduces the amount of Energy he needs from 70 to 55,  which makes building
      Mika much easier. Since in Eula teams Mika is forced to funnel his own
      particles to Eula, lowering his Energy needs is important.

      Increases his Attack Speed buff by 3%. For Eula players, this is not
      enough to garner an extra stack for Lightfall Sword.

      > *The maximum number of Detector stacks that Starfrost Swirl's Soulwind
      can gain is increased by 1. You need to have unlocked the Passive Talent
      "Suppressive Barrage" first.

      > Additionally, active characters affected by Soulwind will deal 60% more
      Physical CRIT DMG.*


      A significant Constellation for Mika, as this bonus is much more valuable
      than all other buffs that his base kit provides. This solidifies his
      identity as a Physical DMG support.
