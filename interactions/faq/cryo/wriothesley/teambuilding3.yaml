      ### Wriothesley | Hydro | Anemo | Flex

      Freeze teams follow many of the same conventions as Mono Cryo, but have
      the addition of increased safety through freezing enemies. Unfortunately
      this doesn’t prevent Wriothesley constantly reducing his own HP but it can
      help players by stopping enemies from attacking, removing the risk of
      taking any additional damage. Due to his fast Normal Attacks, Wriothesley
      can drive Xingqiu and Yelan particularly well.
