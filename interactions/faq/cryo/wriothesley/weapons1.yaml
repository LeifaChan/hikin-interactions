      **Cashflow Supervision**
    description: >-
      Wriothesley’s BiS, providing him NA and CA DMG% per stack when his current
      HP changes, as well as ATK SPD after 3 stacks, allowing for faster combos,
      shorter field time, and potentially a shorter rotation. Note that with its
      secondary stat (CRIT Rate) and either 4pc MH or BS, you can easily overcap
      his overall CRIT Rate, thus using a CRIT DMG Circlet is recommended.

      Performs similarly to Cashflow Supervision, but without the CA DMG%. The
      CRIT DMG secondary stat is appreciated, especially when using 4pc MH or
      BS.

      All of them perform very similarly. Depending on the scenario, you may
      choose your weapon accordingly. Please check out the
