    description: >-
      Wriothesley’s long field time makes it hard to maintain buffs after he is
      done with his combo .When combined with his long Burst animation, it
      lessens the value of building ER on him. 


      He also only generates particles while he is still in his Chilling Penalty
      state, which also means he would not generate particles when his HP is
      lower than 50%. Note that for most cases, instead of funneling particles
      to him, it's usually worth more for other support characters to catch
      their own particles instead to cast their Burst and further support him
      while also dealing damage.


      Assuming a 20-second rotation, Wriothesley will generate 5 Cryo particles.


      Each Favonius proc will approximately reduce his ER Requirement by ~20 –
      25%.


      Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more
      accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge calculator linked
