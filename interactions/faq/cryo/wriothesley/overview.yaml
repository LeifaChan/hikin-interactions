          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions.

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Wriothesley is a Cryo catalyst that focuses on enhancing and dealing
      damage with his Normal and Charged Attacks, and takes up the majority of
      the team’s field time in order to dish out high amounts of damage. He can
      either be played in a Cryo team (Mono Cryo or Freeze) that emphasize on
      buffing him, or in a Reverse Melt team where he can melt his Cryo Attacks.
      In either of those, Wriothesley teams will focus on having teammates that
      increase Wriothesley’s damage values while taking little field time.
