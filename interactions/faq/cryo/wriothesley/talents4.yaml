      **Ascension 1 Passive: There Shall Be a Plea for Justice**
    description: >-
      This is what makes Wriothesley stand out from Yoimiya and Wanderer. When
      Wriothesley's HP is less than 60%, his next Charged Attack will become
      Rebuke: Vaulting Fist, which deals additional damage, costs no stamina,
      and heals for 30% of his max HP with a 5-second cooldown. 


      The long cooldown between enhanced Charged Attacks makes it difficult to
      get more than two Charged Attacks per rotations for C0 Wriothesley, even
      with ATK SPD. Note that means after attacking and/or getting lower than
      50% Max HP, the remaining Normal Attacks will not get enhanced until he
      gets healed back up, but on the other hand, adding a healer may keep him
      too healthy to the point that he cannot get lower than 60% of his max HP
      meaning that you cannot reliably proc his empowered CA at all.

      When Wriothesley’s current HP changes, he gets 6% ATK, up to five times. A
      simple yet effective buff for him.

      When Wriothesley crafts Weapon Ascension Materials, he has a 10% chance to
      receive double the product.
