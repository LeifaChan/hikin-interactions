      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Forceful Fists of Frost**
    description: >-
      Wriothesley performs a 5-hit combo that cannot be reset by dashing or
      using his Elemental Skill. This talent should be prioritized, since this
      is his main source of damage, which further gets buffed by his Elemental
      Skill – which provides additional NA DMG Bonus (same as Yoimiya/Wanderer’s
      Skill). It's important to note that even though he is a Catalyst user, his
      punches have hitlag like Heizou, which may make his combo feel slower than
      expected. Note that his enhanced Charged Attacks also follow the scaling
      of his Normal Attacks.

      After using his Skill, he enters the Chilling Penalty state, increasing
      his interruption resistance (on par with Hu Tao) and enhancing his Normal
      Attacks. Additionally, it comes with a penalty that makes him lose 4.5% of
      his Max HP per hit. His Energy generation also comes with his Skill,
      generating one Cryo particle if his NA/CA hits per two seconds. Hitlag
      from his Normal Attacks may extend the Chilling Penalty state, however it
      depends on the scenario to conclude if that would favor him or not. 


      Note that when he gets lower than 50% of max HP, the Chilling Penalty
      state will stop working, therefore it is important for him to keep his HP
      high to not lose out on buff uptime.
