    description: >-
      Generally, you want to use Wriothesleyâ€™s Vaulting Fist (indicated by the
      red Aura around him) as soon as it is available to make use of all
      existing buffs before they run out.


      For C0, it is a bit tricky since you may need to do up to 8 consecutive
      Normal Attacks before getting his HP low enough for the enhanced Charged
      Attack to take effect. Even when you get his HP lower than 60% for the
      second time, the cooldown might not be finished, in which you either want
      to Burst while waiting for the Vaulting Fist, or accept that some Normal
      Attacks will not be getting the buff from his Skill.


      With C1+, not only is the empowered CA cooldown cut down by half, but you
      also just need to reach the fifth Normal Attack for the Vaulting Fist
      rather than wait for either the cooldown or HP reduction. This makes N5C
      his best combo after C1.
