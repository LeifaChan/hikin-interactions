    description: >-
      Due to Wriothesley’s long field time, he wants to be paired with
      characters that either buff his personal damage or sub DPS characters who
      can deal their damage whilst taking minimal field time. At C0, Wriothesley
      is unable to self-sustain himself with his A1 Passive, meaning he will
      eventually reach 50% HP or below, even if he doesn’t get hit. Because of
      this, **it is recommended to run a healer with him in all teams and ignore
      his special Charged Attacks unless he ends up proccing one.** At C1+,
      Wriothesley’s special Charged Attack is not only easier to proc, but also
      gains increased healing, allowing his teams to use more offensive options
      over dedicated healers.
