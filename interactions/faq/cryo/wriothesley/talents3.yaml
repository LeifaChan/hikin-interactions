      Wriothesley hits five times in quick succession, dealing decent damage. It
      is usually not worth building enough Energy Recharge to Burst every
      rotation, but rather focus on other offensive stats to buff his Normal and
      Charged Attacks even further. However, this should still be considered for
      leveling since he will generally get buffed and contribute most of the
      team’s damage.
