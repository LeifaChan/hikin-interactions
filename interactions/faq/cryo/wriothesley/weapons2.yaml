      **Flowing Purity**
    description: >-
      The new Craftable from Fontaine works extremely well with Wriothesley,
      providing tons of additional Elemental DMG% after he clears the Bond of
      Life passive, either through his Vaulting Fist or heals from teammates.
      Please note that when running this weapon, Wriothesley will be unable to
      sustain himself at all with just Charged Attacks due to the Bond of Life
      passive preventing healing, making a healer mandatory.

      The 4.1 event weapon is another excellent F2P choice for Wriothesley that
      provides NA and CA DMG% for him. An ER secondary stat is occasionally
      useful if it is enough for him to Burst every rotation.

  - title: '**The Widsith**'
    description: >-
      Widsith really shines when he gets ATK% or DMG% and can clear the content
      in one rotation. Nonetheless, it is still a decent option for longer
      battles due to the nice CRIT DMG secondary stat. EM is only useful when
      played in a Reverse Melt team.
