      ### Wriothesley | Pyro | Flex | Flex

      Another team Wriothesley can take advantage of is Reverse Melt teams due
      to characters like Xiangling, or mechanics such as Burning or Sunfire,
      providing a consistent Pyro Aura for Wriothesley to melt his attacks.
      Characters such as Bennett provide both healing and large Attack buffs,
      which Wriothesley really appreciates, alongside large amounts of Energy
      for Xiangling. Given that Sunfire consists of both Bennett and Jean, it
      may be more comfy for players to use this due to the large amounts of
      healing, with the downside of being very Circle Impact (effects are
      limited to a certain area).
