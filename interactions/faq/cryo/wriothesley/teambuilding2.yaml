      ### Wriothesley | Shenhe | Cryo | Anemo

      Thanks to the existence of Shenhe, Mono Cryo teams can be a strong option.
      Wriothesley can use all of Shenhe’s quills quickly whilst making use of
      both the Normal and Charged Attack DMG% and Cryo RES Shred provided by her
      Hold Skill and Burst respectively. Characters such as Kazuha can further
      increase the team’s damage output, although any Anemo holding 4pc
      Viridescent Venerer also works just to shred Cryo RES. Diona not only
      fills the required role of a healer, but also provides interruption
      resistance through shields and large amounts of Cryo particles, lowering
      the amount of Energy Recharge Wriothesley needs to consistently use his
      Burst.
