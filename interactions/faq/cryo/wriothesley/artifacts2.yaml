      **4PC Marechaussee Hunter**
    description: >-
      4pc MH synergizes really well with Wriothesley’s kit when he’s in the
      *Chilling Penalty state*. Each hit in this state will reduce Wriothesley’s
      current HP, thus he can easily maintain its 4pc effects for up to 36% CRIT
      Rate. When using this set with his Signature (or any weapon with CRIT Rate
      as a secondary stat), he can easily overcap his CRIT Rate, hence, a CR
      Circlet is not recommended with 4pc MH.

      4pc SR will drain Wriothesley’s energy in exchange for 50% NA/CA DMG
      Bonus, making Bursting frequently even harder (up to once every four
      rotations rather than two). It also has anti synergy with his C2 that
      buffs his Burst.

      4pc BS is only useful for Wriothesley when there’s a consistent Cryo Aura
      (i.e Freeze/Mono Cryo). It has the potential to outperform 4pc MH when the
      enemy can be frozen for an extended period and not get affected by Shatter
      coming from his empowered CA. Similar to 4pc MH, a CR Circlet is not
      recommended for this set due to overcapping CRIT Rate.

      They are weaker options compared to 4pc sets, but still usable if the
      pieces have good substats.
