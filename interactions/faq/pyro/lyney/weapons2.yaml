      **Amos' Bow**
    description: >-
      Amos’ Bow is a decent choice for Lyney: stronger than 4-star options, but
      not exceptionally so.

      The 5-star CR bows are strong assuming players are not running 4pc MH on
      Lyney, but that assumes players are, in fact, not running 4pc MH. In the
      recommended scenario in which Lyney is using 4pc MH, the 5-star CR bows
      suffer greatly as Lyney quickly overcaps on CR.

  - title: '**Blackcliff Warbow**'
    description: >-
      Lyney is unlikely to get stacks on Blackcliff in most situations given
      that his single-target focus means his best use case is bossing. Without
      stacks, Blackcliff is a very boring but decent option. Not worth buying
      for Lyney.

    description: >-
      The new BP bow has a useful passive, but suffers the same problem of
      overcapping CR as 5-star CR bows do.  Players might find themselves better
      off just using Song of Stillness.
