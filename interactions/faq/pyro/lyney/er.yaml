  - title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
    description: >-
      Lyney generates 5 particles per Skill, but only casts a single Skill per
      rotation, which leaves his Energy situation with much room to improve.
      Thankfully, his A1 grants some much-needed flat Energy everytime he
      consumes HP through his Charged Attack, an effect that is easily achieved
      with help from a healer. Lyney also runs alongside at least one other Pyro
      unit, further lowering his ER requirements. 


      However, even with all that, Lyneyâ€™s 60-cost Burst means he needs a
      substantial amount of ER to Burst every rotation, except in the most
      Energy-heavy of teams. As a result, more often than not, Lyney prefers to
      not build any ER and instead Burst every other rotation. 


      Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more
      accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge calculator linked
