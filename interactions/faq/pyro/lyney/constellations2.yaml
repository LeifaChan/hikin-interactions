      The first ever Constellation to increase Normal Attack Talent levels,
      Lyney’s C3 provides a strong boost to all of his Charged Attack and
      Pyrotechnic Strike damage. C3 is Lyney’s 2nd strongest Constellation for
      personal damage, falling behind only C6.

      C4 is a solid increase to all of Lyney’s damage in all teams, but its
      value increases further if running a character in Lyney’s team who can
      additionally take advantage of the Pyro RES shred it provides, most
      notably Xiangling. With Xiangling in his team, C4 is a 9.4% DPS increase
      in team damage over C3.
