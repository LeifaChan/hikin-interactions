      **The First Great Magic**
    description: >-
      Tailor-made for Lyney, TFGM provides CRIT DMG% and CA DMG%, as well as
      ATK% that increases with each additional Pyro unit in Lyney’s team. TFGM
      is his BiS even in teams with only 2 Pyro units (including Lyney himself).
      It is about 7% better than the next best option when fully stacked, and 3%
      better with only 2 stacks.

  - title: '**Aqua Simulacra / Thundering Pulse**'
    description: >-
      Aqua’s passive is slightly dubious for Lyney given that his Charged Attack
      playstyle allows him to maintain distance from enemies, and TPulse’s
      stacking passive is entirely useless, but they are nonetheless his
      strongest weapons after TFGM just by being 5-star bows with a CRIT DMG%
      secondary stat. Aqua pulls ahead slightly if its passive is maintained;
      otherwise, TPulse is slightly stronger.

  - title: '**Skyward Harp**'
    description: >-
      Despite Lyney potentially overcapping on CR because of Harp’s CR secondary
      stat, its 5-star stats and CRIT DMG in its passive allows it to be a
      strong option nonetheless.

    description: >-
      The recommended F2P weapon of choice. SoS’s ceiling is slightly lower than
      Prototype Crescent when accounting for refines, but it is more reliable
      than its craftable counterpart.

  - title: '**Prototype Crescent**'
    description: >-
      An alternative to SoS but only if players can reliably trigger its
      passive. At max refinement and with its passive active, PC has the highest
      ceiling of any 4-star weapon for Lyney (not by much), but it suffers
      massively without its passive.
