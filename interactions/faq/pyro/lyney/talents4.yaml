      *CD : **15s**

      Energy Cost : **60***


      Lyney’s Burst turns himself into a giant Grin-Malkin Cat (not to be
      confused with the Grin-Malkin Hat!) for 3s that can prance around. When
      the Grin-Malkin Cat gets close to enemies, it deals a maximum of 1
      instance of Pyro damage to them. 


      Lyney’s Skill button will be transformed into a special button while in
      his Grin-Malkin Cat state, and pressing this special button will end the
      Grin-Malkin Cat state early. Pressing this special button will *not* cast
      his Skill.


      When Lyney’s Grin Malkin Cat state ends — whether naturally or through the
      special button — Lyney will unleash yet another AoE Pyro nuke.
