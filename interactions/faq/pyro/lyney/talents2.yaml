      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Card Force Translocation**
    description: >-
      Lyney has a Charged Attack mechanic similar to the likes of Ganyu or
      Tighnari, where Charged Attacks can be charged past the typical
      fully-charged state for a unique attack. In Lyney’s case, a Charge Level 2
      Attack fires a Prop Arrow, which summons a Grin-Malkin Hat upon hitting
      anything. 


      The Grin-Malkin Hat is a taunt much like Amber’s Baron Bunny, and shares
      many of Baron Bunny’s mechanics. It is detonated at the end of its
      duration (4s), or if it is destroyed early by an enemy. However, there are
      a few more methods to detonate Grin-Malkin Hats. Only one Grin-Malkin Hat
      can exist on the field at C0, and if Lyney summons another Grin-Malkin Hat
      while one is already on the field, the previous one will detonate. Players
      can also detonate Grin-Malkin Hats with Lyney’s Skill.


      When a Grin-Malkin Hat is detonated by any method other than Lyney’s
      Skill, it unleashes a Pyrotechnic Strike that targets a nearby enemy.
      These Pyrotechnic Strikes have a relatively small radius and so are mostly
      single-target, but can actually hit multiple enemies if they are grouped
      closely enough. 


      Additionally, if he is above 60% HP, when Lyney fires a Prop Arrow, he
      consumes 20% of his own max HP in order to obtain a Prop Surplus stack.
      These Prop Surplus stacks increase the damage of his Skill, and can stack
      up to 5 times. Note that even without taking external damage, Lyney will
      only be able to build 3 stacks without a healer, as he will reach the 60%
      HP threshold within 3 Charged Attacks. This means it is important to run
      Lyney with a healer, even when overlooking the obvious question of
      survivability.  


      Finally, Lyney’s Prop Arrows summon an instance of Pneuma-aligned damage
      every 6s, which has negligible damage but crucially, triggers an
      Annihilation reaction when hitting an Ousia-aligned enemy that may make
      enemies significantly easier to fight. This will be hugely beneficial in
      the early patches of Fontaine, during which there are a limited number of
      characters that can deal Pneuma-aligned damage.
