      **Elemental Skill: Bewildering Lights**
    description: >-
      *CD : **15s***
      
      Lyney’s Skill heals himself for 20% of his Max HP and deals a single
      instance of AoE Pyro damage that increases with each Prop Surplus stack he
      has at cast in a fashion similar to Heizou’s Skill. With stacks, his Skill
      becomes a potent AoE nuke, but its 15s cooldown means he can only cast it
      once per rotation. 


      Lyney’s Skill will additionally detonate any Grin-Malkin Hats that exist
      on-field upon cast. Grin-Malkin Hats that are detonated by Lyney’s Skill
      will unleash Pyrotechnic Strikes, but these Pyrotechnic Strikes uniquely
      have a much larger AoE than usual.
