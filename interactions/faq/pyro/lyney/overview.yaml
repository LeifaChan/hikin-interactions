          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions. 

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Lyney is a Pyro Bow user whose kit revolves around summoning Grin-Malkin
      Hats with his Charged Attacks or Burst, then subsequently detonating them
      to trigger high-damage Pyrotechnic Strikes. His damage is primarily
      single-target, though this can be mitigated by running a powerful grouper
      or a sub-DPS with AOE damage.


      Because he takes up much of his teams’ field time, his teammates are
      typically characters who buff or supplement his damage in some way while
      occupying relatively little field time. However, his teams are limited by
      his Aimed Shot gameplay, making popular options like Xingqiu a hassle to
      use. Furthermore, his Ascension 4 Talent highly encourages Mono Pyro and
      other mostly reaction-less teams by greatly rewarding maintaining a Pyro
      aura on enemies and stacking multiple Pyro teammates.
