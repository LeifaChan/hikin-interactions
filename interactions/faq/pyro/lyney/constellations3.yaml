      C5 is a mostly negligible damage increase, especially in teams where Lyney
      only Bursts once every two rotations.

      Lyney’s C6 is his best Constellation, with the additional attack on every
      Charged Attack being a relatively straightforward but significant boost to
      Lyney’s damage.


      Overall, Lyney’s Constellations increase his damage while changing little
      about his playstyle. It is worth noting that teams that focus on directly
      buffing Lyney’s damage benefit the most from his Constellations, since
      they further increase the damage gain from each Constellation.
