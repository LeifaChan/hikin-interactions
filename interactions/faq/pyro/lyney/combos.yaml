  - title: '**General Lyney Combo Notes:**'
    description: >-
      - With the exception of with 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence, Lyney wants to
      cast his Skill at the very end of his combo to maximize stacks. When
      running 4pc Shime, Lyney wants to cast his Skill at the beginning of his
      combo or after one Charged Attack instead of at the end of his combo.


      - Casting Lyney’s Burst at the start of the combo allows Lyney to obtain
      Energy in the first rotation, while casting Burst at the end allows it to
      receive the fully stacked 4pc MH bonus. Players may also cast Lyney’s
      Burst after two Charged Attacks as a compromise, and to ensure that the
      4pc VV effect is active during Lyney’s Burst.


      - It is recommended that players cancel Lyney’s Burst early so as to not
      waste time in his Grin-Malkin Cat state.


      - If Bursting every other rotation, in rotations during which Lyney does
      not Burst, insert a Charged Attack where he would otherwise Burst.


      - Lyney will usually fire 3-4 Charged Attacks per combo, not including any
      Charged Attacks he does in place of a Burst. Generally speaking, as long
      as everything fits into the primary window of buffs, it’s worth slightly
      extending rotations to get in another Charged Attack.
