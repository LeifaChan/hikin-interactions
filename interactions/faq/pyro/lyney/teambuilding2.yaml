      ### <:flex:1094549077280169984> **Defensive Flex Options:**

      **Zhongli**: Zhongli is a very strong candidate for the defensive flex
      position, providing a hefty shield that can maintain full uptime and
      syncing with Lyney’s 15s cooldowns. He even gains an offensive edge with
      his universal 20% RES shred. He can hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith or
      4pc Archaic Petra, although Archaic Petra may be inconvenient to use. 

      **Yanfei**: Yanfei’s C4 makes her a strong Pyro shielder that Lyney can
      make use of. Being Pyro allows Yanfei to contribute to stacks on Lyney’s
      A4 and signature weapon. Furthermore, if Yanfei can obtain enough ER
      without Prototype Amber or an ER weapon, and players are willing to
      sacrifice shield strength for offensive power, she can hold Thrilling
      Tales of Dragon Slayers to buff Lyney. However, it is worth noting that
      Yanfei’s C4 shield being tied to her Burst forces rotations to be extended
      to upwards of 20s.

      **Dehya**: Even though Dehya isn’t a shielder, her A1 talent allows her to
      provide the interruption resistance Lyney wants, and her damage mitigation
      similarly increases Lyney’s survivability. She can also hold 4pc Tenacity
      of the Millelith to buff Lyney. Because she is a Pyro unit, she can also
      contribute to stacks on Lyney’s A4 and signature weapon. However, she
      forces rotations to be extended to a minimum of 20s and has poor uptime.

      **Xinyan**: With C2, Xinyan can build high ER (around 230%) to Burst every
      rotation to fit into 15s rotations, guarantee a Favonius Greatsword proc,
      and hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith. As a Pyro unit, she can also
      contribute to stacks on Lyney’s A4 and signature weapon. However, without C2, she loses the ability to guarantee a Level 3 shield
      and the benefits that come with it, and extends rotations with her 18s
      Skill cooldown.

      **Layla / Kirara / Diona / Baizhu**: All viable shielders, none of whom
      are especially notable in Lyney teams. Layla can provide some additional
      chip damage, while Diona and Baizhu provide a little extra healing, but
      otherwise all four mostly perform similarly. Note that Baizhu extends
      rotations.
