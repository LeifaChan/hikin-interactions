      **Ascension 1 Passive: Perilous Performance**
    description: >-
      Lyney’s A1 further incentivizes running a healer by increasing his damage
      and refunding flat Energy if he consumes HP while firing a Prop Arrow,
      which is only feasible after a point with a healer. The damage increase is
      minor but appreciated. The flat Energy refund can be quite substantial as
      Lyney fires about 3-5 Prop Arrows per rotation, netting him about 9-15
      flat Energy.

  - title: '**Ascension 4 Passive: Conclusive Ovation**'
    description: >-
      Lyney’s A4 is where his kit becomes especially interesting. A4 grants
      Lyney an absolutely massive buff (60% DMG at base) if he attacks enemies
      affected by Pyro that increases with every Pyro teammate (20% DMG per
      teammates, up to a maximum of 100% DMG total). Lyney effectively never
      runs solo Pyro, so he will always have at least a whopping 80% DMG from
      this passive. 


      This passive greatly incentivizes teams that can maintain a constant Pyro
      aura, especially mono Pyro teams, which tend to have a greater number of
      Pyro units. It also discourages teams that utilize reactions that may
      interfere with a Pyro aura, such as Overload or Vaporize. 


      While Lyney can technically still be played in teams that don’t maintain a
      constant Pyro aura on enemies, it will come with great loss to his damage
      and not much in return in most cases.
