      ### <:flex:1094549077280169984> **Offensive Flex Options:**

      **Kazuha**: Kazuha’s ability to buff Lyney’s Pyro DMG% and use 4pc
      Viridescent Venerer all while syncing up with Lyney’s 15s cooldowns makes
      him the ideal unit for maximizing Lyney’s personal damage. He additionally
      provides a considerable amount of personal damage, and some grouping of
      debatable usefulness.


      **Venti**: Venti’s powerful grouping uniquely allows Lyney to take
      advantage of the small AoE on his Pyrotechnic Strikes, allowing Lyney to
      deal with groups of enemies as long as they can be lifted by Venti’s
      Burst. Venti also does significant damage in his own right in such
      situations, and he can use 4pc Viridescent Venerer to shred enemy Pyro
      RES. Additionally, he can refund 15 Flat Energy to Lyney and all other
      Pyro units in the team, which is hugely beneficial to reducing ER
      requirements.

      However, Venti struggles in single-target situations or against enemies
      that his Burst cannot lift, so it is not recommended to bring him against
      those lineups.


      **Xiangling**: Xiangling is a powerful Pyro sub-DPS who provides strong
      AoE damage from off-field while also allowing Lyney to max out on his A4
      and signature weapon passive effects. Bennett is more essential than ever
      with Xiangling the team, as she greatly appreciates his Pyro particle
      generation and is able to take full advantage of his ATK buffs. 

      However, her Burst requires Lyney to play at point-blank range, which
      players may find unpleasant to play.  If players are struggling to pilot
      Lyney because Xiangling forces them to play at point-black range, causing
      Lyney to miss out on Charged Attacks, then any damage gained from running
      Xiangling may be canceled out. In such cases, it is recommended that
      players opt not to run Xiangling with Lyney. 


      **C2 Klee**: An expensive buffing option who can provide DEF shred,
      Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer, and allow Lyney to max out on his A4 and
      signature weapon passive effects.


      **Heizou / Sucrose**: If Kazuha is otherwise occupied, players can also
      use Heizou or Sucrose as a generic Anemo support by equipping them with
      4pc Viridescent Venerer and Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer. 

      Heizou gains a slight advantage by being able to contribute some extra
      damage, and Sucrose’s EM share is entirely useless in Lyney teams (unless
      running double offensive flex with Rosaria), so her talents may be better
      utilized elsewhere.  


      **Other Anemos**: Other Anemo characters such as Lynette, AMC, Jean, and
      Sayu can all be used to hold 4pc Viridescent Venerer’s. None of them are
      particularly standout otherwise.


      **Albedo**: Albedo can be run as an easy-to-play sub-DPS. With Zhongli,
      Lyney and himself can gain some buffs from Geo Resonance; otherwise,
      Albedo simply provides off-field damage while not interfering much with
      the Pyro auras Lyney wants.
