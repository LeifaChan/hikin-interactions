      Other decent, consistent alternatives to 4pc Lavawalker, but only
      affecting Lyney’s Charged Attacks. Retracing Bolide requires good shield
      uptime.

      4pc Shime should only be used in teams where Lyney casts his Burst once
      per two rotations. Otherwise, Lyney’s ER requirement will increase to the
      point where 4pc Shime becomes a DPS loss. In the situations where it does
      work, 4pc Shime is slightly stronger than 4pc Lavawalker, although still
      markedly weaker than 4pc MH.

      In direct opposition to 4pc Shime, 4pc VH should only be used in teams
      where Lyney casts his Burst every rotation. In the situations where it
      works, it can be about on par with 4pc Lavawalker.
