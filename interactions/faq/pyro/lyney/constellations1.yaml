      > *Lyney can have 2 Grin-Malkin Hats present at once. Additionally, Prop
      Arrows will summon 2 Grin-Malkin Hats and grant Lyney 1 extra stack of
      Prop Surplus. This effect can occur once every 15s.*


      In practice, C1 allows Lyney to detonate one additional Grin-Malkin Hat
      per rotation. C1 gains little value in teams where Lyney does not max out
      Prop Surplus stacks naturally, but ultimately is a relatively modest
      increase in damage.

      > *When Lyney is on the field, he will gain a stack of Crisp Focus every
      2s. This will increase his CRIT DMG by 20%. Max 3 stacks. This effect will
      be canceled when Lyney leaves the field.*


      C2 is a relatively straightforward stacking buff to Lyney’s CRIT DMG.
      Thanks to buffs from his teammates, his BiS artifact set, and his A4
      Talent, among other things, Lyney tends to be oversaturated in all manner
      of offensive stats. However, Lyney can only obtain CRIT DMG from artifact
      stats and his weapon, making it a little more difficult to come by than
      most. As a result, C2 provides a substantial boost to Lyney’s damage.
