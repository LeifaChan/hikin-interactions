      __TALENT PRIORITY__

      **Normal Attack > Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst**
    description: >-
      ## __Analysis__


      - All Pyrotechnic Strike damage scales off of Lyney’s Normal Attack
      talent, and his Charged Attacks themselves do a significant amount of
      damage, so maxing Lyney’s Normal Attack talent is first priority.


      - After his NA talent, leveling either of his Skill or Burst talents
      provide similar returns, so they should be leveled in tandem. Leveling
      Lyney’s Skill talent is slightly more valuable if Bursting only once every
      2 rotations, and leveling his Burst talent pulls ahead slightly if
      Bursting every rotation.

      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Card Force Translocation**
    description: >-
      Lyney has a Charged Attack mechanic similar to the likes of Ganyu or
      Tighnari, where Charged Attacks can be charged past the typical
      fully-charged state for a unique attack. In Lyney’s case, a Charge Level 2
      Attack fires a Prop Arrow, which summons a Grin-Malkin Hat upon hitting
      anything. 


      The Grin-Malkin Hat is a taunt much like Amber’s Baron Bunny, and shares
      many of Baron Bunny’s mechanics. It is detonated at the end of its
      duration (4s), or if it is destroyed early by an enemy. However, there are
      a few more methods to detonate Grin-Malkin Hats. Only one Grin-Malkin Hat
      can exist on the field at C0, and if Lyney summons another Grin-Malkin Hat
      while one is already on the field, the previous one will detonate. Players
      can also detonate Grin-Malkin Hats with Lyney’s Skill.


      When a Grin-Malkin Hat is detonated by any method other than Lyney’s
      Skill, it unleashes a Pyrotechnic Strike that targets a nearby enemy.
      These Pyrotechnic Strikes have a relatively small radius and so are mostly
      single-target, but can actually hit multiple enemies if they are grouped
      closely enough. 


      Additionally, if he is above 60% HP, when Lyney fires a Prop Arrow, he
      consumes 20% of his own max HP in order to obtain a Prop Surplus stack.
      These Prop Surplus stacks increase the damage of his Skill, and can stack
      up to 5 times. Note that even without taking external damage, Lyney will
      only be able to build 3 stacks without a healer, as he will reach the 60%
      HP threshold within 3 Charged Attacks. This means it is important to run
      Lyney with a healer, even when overlooking the obvious question of
      survivability.  


      Finally, Lyney’s Prop Arrows summon an instance of Pneuma-aligned damage
      every 6s, which has negligible damage but crucially, triggers an
      Annihilation reaction when hitting an Ousia-aligned enemy that may make
      enemies significantly easier to fight. This will be hugely beneficial in
      the early patches of Fontaine, during which there are a limited number of
      characters that can deal Pneuma-aligned damage.

      *CD : **15s***


      Lyney’s Skill heals himself for 20% of his Max HP and deals a single
      instance of AoE Pyro damage that increases with each Prop Surplus stack he
      has at cast in a fashion similar to Heizou’s Skill. With stacks, his Skill
      becomes a potent AoE nuke, but its 15s cooldown means he can only cast it
      once per rotation. 


      Lyney’s Skill will additionally detonate any Grin-Malkin Hats that exist
      on-field upon cast. Grin-Malkin Hats that are detonated by Lyney’s Skill
      will unleash Pyrotechnic Strikes, but these Pyrotechnic Strikes uniquely
      have a much larger AoE than usual.

      *CD : **15s**

      Energy Cost : **60***


      Lyney’s Burst turns himself into a giant Grin-Malkin Cat (not to be
      confused with the Grin-Malkin Hat!) for 3s that can prance around. When
      the Grin-Malkin Cat gets close to enemies, it deals a maximum of 1
      instance of Pyro damage to them. 


      Lyney’s Skill button will be transformed into a special button while in
      his Grin-Malkin Cat state, and pressing this special button will end the
      Grin-Malkin Cat state early. Pressing this special button will *not* cast
      his Skill.


      When Lyney’s Grin Malkin Cat state ends — whether naturally or through the
      special button — Lyney will unleash yet another AoE Pyro nuke.

      __Passives__

      **Ascension 1 Passive: Perilous Performance**
    description: >-
      Lyney’s A1 further incentivizes running a healer by increasing his damage
      and refunding flat Energy if he consumes HP while firing a Prop Arrow,
      which is only feasible after a point with a healer. The damage increase is
      minor but appreciated. The flat Energy refund can be quite substantial as
      Lyney fires about 3-5 Prop Arrows per rotation, netting him about 9-15
      flat Energy.

  - title: '**Ascension 4 Passive: Conclusive Ovation**'
    description: >-
      Lyney’s A4 is where his kit becomes especially interesting. A4 grants
      Lyney an absolutely massive buff (60% DMG at base) if he attacks enemies
      affected by Pyro that increases with every Pyro teammate (20% DMG per
      teammates, up to a maximum of 100% DMG total). Lyney effectively never
      runs solo Pyro, so he will always have at least a whopping 80% DMG from
      this passive. 


      This passive greatly incentivizes teams that can maintain a constant Pyro
      aura, especially mono Pyro teams, which tend to have a greater number of
      Pyro units. It also discourages teams that utilize reactions that may
      interfere with a Pyro aura, such as Overload or Vaporize. 


      While Lyney can technically still be played in teams that don’t maintain a
      constant Pyro aura on enemies, it will come with great loss to his damage
      and not much in return in most cases.
