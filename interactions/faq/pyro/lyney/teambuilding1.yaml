      Thanks to his HP consumption mechanics, Lyney wants at least one healer to
      keep him alive and allow him to build Prop Surplus stacks and activate his
      A1. Bennett provides this, but additionally provides a massive ATK boost
      and 4pc Noblesse Oblige to greatly improve Lyney’s damage. Furthermore, as
      a Pyro unit, Bennett counts towards stacks on Lyney’s A4 and signature
      weapon. To top it all off, he helps generate Pyro particles to fund Lyney
      and other energy-hungry Pyro units. Because Bennett is able to provide so
      much utility in just one slot, it is highly recommended to run him
      alongside Lyney in every one of Lyney’s teams. Players may opt to replace
      him with another healer, but will do so to much worse effect. 

      It is recommended to run a healing-focused build on Bennett (HP%/HB
      artifacts) in Lyney teams, in order to ensure that Lyney receives
      sufficient healing to stay above the 60% HP threshold. The damage lost on
      Bennett from building for healing instead of damage is not significant in
      Lyney teams.


      Bennett aside, because Lyney’s Charged Attack playstyle makes him highly
      susceptible to interruption as well as his damage suffering greatly from
      being interrupted, Lyney appreciates a shielder or character who can
      provide interruption resistance. 


      Lastly, Lyney wants a more offensively oriented unit in his team to buff
      and/or supplement his damage. Generally speaking, teams that focus on
      buffing Lyney’s personal damage are preferred in single-target scenarios,
      where Lyney excels. Conversely, in multi-target situations, it is more
      beneficial to bring Venti or a unit who can deal AoE damage to compensate
      for Lyney’s relatively low amount of AoE damage. 


      While not recommended, if players feel confident in their ability to play
      Lyney without a shielder, they can opt to bring a second offensive flex
      unit instead. 


      It is essential that Lyney’s teammates do not interfere with maintaining a
      constant Pyro aura on enemies, and are compatible with his Charged Attack
      playstyle, which somewhat limits his options.
