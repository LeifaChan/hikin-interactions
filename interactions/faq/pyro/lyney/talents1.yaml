      __TALENT PRIORITY__

      **Normal Attack > Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst**

      ## __Analysis__


      - All Pyrotechnic Strike damage scales off of Lyney’s Normal Attack
      talent, and his Charged Attacks themselves do a significant amount of
      damage, so maxing Lyney’s Normal Attack talent is first priority.


      - After his NA talent, leveling either of his Skill or Burst talents
      provide similar returns, so they should be leveled in tandem. Leveling
      Lyney’s Skill talent is slightly more valuable if Bursting only once every
      2 rotations, and leveling his Burst talent pulls ahead slightly if
      Bursting every rotation.
