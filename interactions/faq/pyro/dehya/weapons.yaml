      Dehya’s weapons depend on whether she is built for reaction or
      non-reaction damage. Non-reaction damage (on-field) focuses on ER%, CRIT%,
      and ATK%, while reaction damage (off-field) focuses instead on pure
      Elemental Mastery.


      Here I will list the main recommendations, from her signature weapon to
      the most freely accessible weapon. However, for a more complete idea of
      weapon rankings, please refer to the mastersheet included here, make a
      copy, and play with the filters to examine the relationships with buffs in
      more detail.

      **ON-FIELD DEHYA**

      1. Beacon of the Reed Sea
    description: >-
      It gives CRIT Rate, ATK%, and (when not shielded) HP%. It’s basically a
      stat stick for Dehya meant to appeal to all of her on-field attributes.
      There are no other special effects to this weapon. Just use your Skill
      twice for the maximum ATK% buff and play as normal.

      **3. Akuoumaru (R5; 270 Energy across team)** 

      Makes Dehya’s Burst stronger. You’ll notice these weapons don’t really
      have much to say other than “it gives a bunch of stats”


      **4. Wolf’s Gravestone / The Unforged (or Akuoumaru R3)**

      Both give lots of ATK%, and the passives are mostly equal. No other weapon
      affects their placement regardless of whether the passive is active or
      not.


      ** 5. Blackcliff Slasher / Serpent Spine (any refinement) / Luxurious
      Sea-Lord**

      Dehya cannot maintain stacks even if shielded, since she takes damage
      while off-field as well. Pick whichever weapon is easiest to build based
      on your artifact substats. Serpent Spine still edges out above the other
      two due to having non-zero uptime on the buff. 


      **6. Favonius Greatsword**

      Favonius Greatsword is by far the worst Claymore for Dehya’s personal
      damage out of this ranking, except in a selective number of circumstances.
      For example, with Ayaka, Rosaria, and Bennett, Dehya needs Favonius
      Greatsword to function in order to help manage team ER requirements, and
      this team can deal more damage and provide better Elemental coverage than
      a Mono Pyro team. It is also useful if you struggle to find an ER Sands.
      However, it is 5-7% below the next best free-to-play option, making it a
      “bare-minimum” choice.

      **OFF-FIELD (BURGEON) DEHYA**

      1. Makhaira Aquamarine (any refinement)
    description: >-
      It only barely falls behind the personal damage of the new event weapon,
      Mailed Flower. However, its teamwide Flat ATK buff based on Dehya’s
      Elemental Mastery is what makes this weapon stand as the top-choice. It’s
      not worth breaking the bank, but if you have it, use it. 

      R5 is of course better, but R3 and R1 do not fall far behind in personal
      damage.

  - title: 2. Mailed Flower (R5)
    description: >-
      Best for personal damage, but only by 1%. However, it ***is free*** and
      getting R5 of a limited 4-star weapon is usually ***not free.***

      **3. Rainslasher (any refinement) **

      This assumes any amount of uptime on Rainslasher’s passive. 


      **4. Bloodtainted Greatsword**

      The easiest possible weapon to obtain for Dehya.


      **5. The Bell (any refinement)**

      Not recommended, but it functions.  You’re better off with an Elemental
      Mastery weapon.
