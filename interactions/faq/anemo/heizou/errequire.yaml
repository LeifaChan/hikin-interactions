  - title: ER REQUIREMENTS
    description: >-
      Generally, he would want to cast 2 Elemental Skill in one rotation due to
      him running as a solo Anemo most of the time, which makes his ER
      Requirement quite low and his particle generation is based on how many
      stacks he has before casting his Elemental Skill. __**Typically, 130-140%
      is his ER Requirement on 0-1 stack, 120-130% on 2-3 stack, and 110-120% on
      4 stacks.**__ Please note that ER Requirement will be based on how long
      the rotation will be so these are just an estimated assumption ER
      Requirements.
