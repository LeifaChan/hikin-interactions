      A team composition
      that is really flexible with its option and Heizou as the Main Driver.
      Usually will need a Hydro and Electro unit to work but the numbers of said
      Element units will be placed depending on your options.

      A team composition composing of Xiangling, Bennett, and
      Xingqiu. Heizou in this team composition fits in well as a VV carrier to
      buff all off-field damage that is being cast. Pretty strong team to say at
      least.

      Focuses on improving Heizou’s NA
      DMG while also providing enough buff to give into his Elemental Skill and
      Elemental Burst. Would not recommend running this as there are better
      options.
