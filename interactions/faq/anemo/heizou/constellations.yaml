  - title: C1
    description: >- 
      The biggest change in his entire combo section. Provides 1 free
      Declension stack and 15% ATK SPD for 5s that allows him to shorten his
      time with the same combo or make the same rotation time but with more
      damage provided with his kit.

  - title: C2
    description: >- 
      Provides a stronger pull for his Elemental Burst.
      Self-explanatory but generally is not needed due to his Elemental Burst
      already providing a pull.


      ***DMG Increase from C0: 8% || DMG Increase from Previous Cons: 0%***

  - title: C3
    description: >- 
      Increases his Elemental Skill Talent LVL by 3. Provides more
      damage to his main damage source and is a good stop point for his
      constellations


      ***DMG Increase from C0: 15% || DMG Increase from Previous Cons: 7%***

  - title: C4
    description: >- 
      Generally a good constellation. Provides 13.5 flat energy for his
      Elemental Burst, which makes his ER Requirement lower but due to him
      needing to cast his Elemental Skill 2 times in 1 rotation makes this
      constellation on the weaker increase side.

  - title: C5
    description: >- 
      Increases his Elemental Burst Talent LVL by 3. Increase its
      damage nonetheless.


      ***DMG Increase from C0: 17% || DMG Increase from Previous Cons: 2%***

  - title: C6
    description: >- 
      Gives Heizou 64 CV on his Elemental Skill, which makes this
      constellation really powerful for all the builds he can run on, and with
      him casting 2 of his Elemental Skill gives out more damage overall and is
      a nice constellation to get.


      ***DMG Increase from C0: 29% || DMG Increase from Previous Cons: 10%***
