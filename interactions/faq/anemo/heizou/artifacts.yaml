      There are many build options on Heizou as he is an Anemo unit and his MV
      scales off of ATK%. These builds will depend on what type of rotation you will
      be running on him as some team compositions will need him on Triple EM and
      some in ADC but all of these are relatively close.


      **ADC Build:**


      **Timepiece: ATK%

      Goblet: Anemo DMG%

      Circlet: CRIT**


      ***Substat Priority***

      CR%=CD% > ATK% > EM


      **EDC Build:**


      **Timepiece: EM

      Goblet: Anemo DMG%

      Circlet: CRIT**


      ***Substat Priority***

      ATK% > CR% = CD% > EM


      **Triple EM:**


      **Timepiece: EM

      Goblet: EM

      Circlet: EM**


      ***Substat Priority***

      EM > ATK% > CR%=CD%

      His BiS option as it provides 60% Swirl
      DMG and 40% Resistance Shred for the party and his Swirls, and its 2PC
      providing 15% Anemo DMG on top that generally fits his driving style.

  - title: 2PC Viridescent Venerer 2PC ATK%
    description: >- 
      Good substitute for 4PC VV.
      Provides 18% ATK and 15% Anemo DMG Bonus. If no 4PC VV of said main stat
      choices are available, this is a good option.

    description: >-
      Gives out 36% ATK. EDC prefers this as a secondary
      option due to the lack of ATK% on that build.

    description: >-
      80 EM helps with his
      Swirl capabilities and the added 15% Anemo DMG Bonus for his Elemental
      Skill but still gets outperformed by the other options due to the lack of
      ATK%

  - title: 2PC Wanderer’s Troupe 2PC ATK%
    description: >-
      80 EM for his Swirls and 18% ATK for
      everything else. Decent option but still gets outclassed by other easily
      farmed options

  - title: 4PC Thundering Fury
    description: >-
      A questionable option as of now since it needs
      live-testing to see if it would work on him. Able to reduce his Elemental
      Skill CD to give a shorter rotation time needed to cast his 2nd Elemental
      Skill. Theoretically, would need another Anemo unit for this artifact set
      to function, strict team composition that allows Heizou to spread
      Electro-based reactions, works best with a Electro-Charged team
      composition, and 2 or more targets for said reaction for Heizou to spread
      in that team composition.
