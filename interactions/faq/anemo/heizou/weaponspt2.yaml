  - title: Sacrificial Fragments
    description: >- 
      Gacha 4* option. Provides EM and at high
      refinement, is able to give him another cast of Elemental Skill on half of
      the combo but will need his timing to be perfect in order to align the
      Elemental Skill CD on the next on-field time for him.

  - title: Dodoco Tales
    description: >- 
      Exclusive event weapon back in 1.6. Able to buff his
      Charged ATK that gives off Swirls and gives ATK% to his Elemental Burst or
      Elemental Skill based on his combo rotation.

  - title: Wine and Song
    description: >- 
      A weapon banner exclusive weapon. Generally would
      make his rotation time much longer due to the fact he needs to dash in
      order to get the buff.

  - title: Blackcliff Agate
    description: >- 
      A good F2P option that is on the Starglitter Shop.
      In theory on a 2 or more target, this would be on the top near Widsith and
      Solar Pearl but its passive really is not in favor of what Heizou achieves
      as his kit really excels in Single Target due to his kit not having AoE
      except his Elemental Burst.

  - title: Oathsworn Eye
    description: >- 
      Exclusive event weapon back in 2.5. Provides ER% on
      its passive but is not needed on Heizou so the small ATK% that it provides
      really is lackluster compared to other options.

  - title: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers
    description: >- 
      Typical supportive weapon that helps
      other party members with their damage when swapping Heizou out of the
      field. Really valuable with how long rotations are going for Heizou and
      the fact that he has 2 parts of on-field time during those.
