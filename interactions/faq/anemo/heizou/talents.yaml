    description: 'Leveling priority: Skill = Normal Attack > Burst'

  - title: Analysis
    description: >-
      This leveling priority specializes in him being a driver for a team
      composition. With his Elemental Skill having the highest amount of damage
      in his kit, it will be prioritized first. Leveling up his Normal Attacks
      is optional due to the fact his main damage source from it is by
      triggering Swirls, which scales off the Character Level and Elemental
      Mastery.

  - title: Normal Attacks
    description: >-
      Heizou Normal and Charged Attacks is pretty special: being melee attacks. It has decent scaling and is used to deal damage while building up Declension stacks for his Skill. Note that his Charged Attacks does not have ICD, which mean it applies Anemo every time it hit.

  - title: Elemental Skill
    description: >-
      His Elemental Skill is pretty straightforward. More stacks means more
      damage and getting those stacks will rely on what combo you use on him to
      utilize his A1 Passive, in which if he Swirls, he will get 1 Stack of
      Declension.

  - title: Elemental Burst
    description: >-
      His Elemental Burst is as simple as a little grouping
      mechanism in his kit, with the knockback of Windmuster Iris supporting
      said CC. Windmuster Iris is an Elemental Absorption Type of damage which
      means it will depend on the absorb Element DMG Bonus for its damage. His
      A4 Passive is just the same as Sucrose A1 but instead of Swirls, he needs
      to cast his Elemental Skill to proc it.
