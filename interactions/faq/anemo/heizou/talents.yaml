    Leveling Priority

    **E = NA > Q**


    This leveling priority specializes in him being a driver for a team
    composition. With his Elemental Skill having the highest amount of damage
    in his kit, it will be prioritized first. Leveling up his Normal Attacks
    is optional due to the fact his main damage source from it is by
    triggering Swirls, which scales off the Character Level and Elemental
    Mastery.

    His Elemental Skill is pretty straightforward. More stacks means more
    damage and getting those stacks will rely on what combo you use on him to
    utilize his A1 Passive, in which if he Swirls, he will get 1 Stack of
    Declension. His Elemental Burst is as simple as a little grouping
    mechanism in his kit, with the knockback of Windmuster Iris supporting
    said CC. Windmuster Iris is an Elemental Absorption Type of damage which
    means it will depend on the absorb Element DMG Bonus for its damage. His
    A4 Passive is just the same as Sucrose A1 but instead of Swirls, he needs
    to cast his Elemental Skill to proc it.
