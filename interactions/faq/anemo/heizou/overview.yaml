- title: CHARACTER OVERVIEW
  description: >-
    Shikanoin Heizou is a 4* Anemo Catalyst that specializes in on-field
    damage and driving off-field damage such as Xingqiu’s Rainsword, Yelan’s
    Exquisite Throw, etc. With his ability to drive this type of damage, it is
    clear that he will replace Sucrose in some teams due to his high Elemental
    Skill MV’s but the lack of supportive capabilities for his party members
    like Sucrose’s A4 and C6.


    Carrying 4PC Viridescent Venerer as its BiS in Solo Anemo teams, he
    already is a good unit with this set. On top of that, his high MV
    Elemental Skill provides a lot of damage to his overall kit as his
    Elemental Burst gives a decent grouping mechanism. He has a stacking
    mechanic on his Elemental Skill, where the max stacks you have on him, the
    stronger his Elemental Skill damage is. 4 stacks can be obtained and you
    can get these stacks by triggering Swirls which the A1 passive contains.
    His A4 is just like Sucrose A1. C1 helps with this as it provides 1 stack
    for when swapping Heizou on-field and ATK SPD for him. Good stop point in
    constellation.
