  - title: COMBOS/ROTATION
    description: >-
      For his combos, it will highly depend on what rotation you will put him.
      The longer the rotation, the longer the combo that he needs to perform in
      order to meet the time criteria for his team composition. **There is also
      the fact that his C1 will shorten or provide the same time but with more
      NA due to how it functions with its ATK SPD Buff and 1 Free Declension
      Stacks.**


      Combos would want to meet these categories in order to perform well in
      terms of damage that he will provide in said team compositions:


      **1. The amount of Swirls**

      **2. Elemental Skill Cast and 4 Stacks of Declension**

      **3. 14-16s of on-field time for driving**
