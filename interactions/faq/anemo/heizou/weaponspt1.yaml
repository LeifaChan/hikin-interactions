      These weapon options are calculated with 3 of his potential builds and are
      the most recommended to run based on the team composition that he is in.

  - title: Memory of Dust
    description: >- 
      Surprisingly, the best 5 star option for him.
      Provides a huge amount of ATK% that really fits Heizou’s driving style as
      the stacking ATK% passive relies on hits to be triggered to get said
      stacks and Heizou’s N4 has 3 hits so it would make the stacking of this
      weapon faster. Needs a shield to get the maximum amount of ATK% buff so a
      shielder is mandatory.

  - title: Skyward Atlas
    description: >- 
      Good 5 star option as it is on the Standard Banner.
      Provides Elemental DMG Bonus as well as a damage proc when hitting an
      enemy with a Normal or Charged Attack but caveat is that it only will proc
      once per rotation depending on the timing of Heizou’s combo.

  - title: Kagura's Verity
    description: >- 
      Exclusive 5 star option. Good stat stick for him as
      it provides CD% along with the passive of increasing his Elemental Skill
      DMG but he can only maximize it to 2 stacks so the half of the passive is
      not being triggered.

  - title: Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds
    description: >- 
      Another good 5 star option as it is a
      CR% Weapon. Provides Elemental DMG Bonus but needs to be on the field
      longer to get said bonuses due to its passive relying on the holder being
      on-field for 16s to get the maximum amount of buff. This weapon will
      highly depend on the combo time for Heizou.

  - title: Solar Pearl
    description: >- 
      Good 4 star option but it is locked via the Battlepass.
      Its passive fits well with Heizou as getting the Declension stacks will
      get this passive up for his Elemental Burst and Elemental Skill as well as
      casting those after will increase his driving potential more.

  - title: The Widsith
    description: >- 
      4 star RNG Weapon and its RNG Buffs that only applies in the
      first half of his combo. All of the buffs in this weapon benefit his
      entire damage as ATK% and Elemental DMG% buffs his entire kit while the EM
      buffs his Swirl damage. All of these buffs are almost the same in terms
      of damage. Only caveat is that the buff can only be active every other
      rotation so the next rotation after the buff has been placed, it would not
      receive it.

  - title: Mappa Mare
    description: >- 
      F2P 4* option. Provides EM for his Swirls and Elemental
      DMG Bonus for his entire kit. Solid option for those F2P Players when
      running Heizou and without Widsith.

  - title: Eye of Perception
    description: >- 
      Gacha 4*. At high refinement, this weapon can get
      at least 2 procs in the whole rotation for Heizou but generally, it only
      provides ATK% on him.

  - title: Hakushin Ring
    description: >- 
      Another F2P 4* option. Gives ER% but generally is not
      needed due to Heizou driving and getting all the particles to himself. The
      passive is really good with driving Electro Reactions such as
      Electro-Charged so that he can buff Anemo, Hydro, and Electro at the same
      time.
