      TEAM SYNERGIES AND COMPOSITIONS
      Fischl
    description: >-
      General unit for Electro-Charged team composition. Provides
      off-field damage and with her A4, able to sustain Electro-Charged if the
      Hydro application is fast enough to be sustained. At C6, Oz should be able
      to be on the field 100% depending on the rotation time.

  - title: Xingqiu
    description: >- 
      Has the fastest Hydro application amongst all Hydro units.
      Able to provide good DMG Reduction and a little bit of healing with his
      Rainswords.

      Substitute if Xingqiu is not available. Able to give a DMG

  - title: Beidou
    description: >- 
      Works well with Fischl as her battery. Able to bounce off
      Electro-Charged to multiple enemy. Her C1 ables to give Heizou a decent
      shield and her C2 and C6 generally helps Electro-Charged team compositions
      better.

  - title: Kuki Shinobu
    description: >- 
      A dedicated healer for Electro-Charged. Good substitute
      to either Fischl or Beidou depending on who to replace. Running her as a
      Solo Electro though would make the Electro-Charged proc slower but
      consistent ownership on her.

  - title: Bennett
    description: >- 
      Able to give out a huge flat ATK buff that most units would
      want. He also has a heal that will suffice on surviving and able to
      cleanse auras off the character.

  - title: Xiangling
    description: >- 
      Good Pyro unit with a powerful off-field DMG. Only caveat
      for Xiangling and Heizou is that he cannot Guoba Swirl, which makes him
      not work well with her for some team compositions that need Guoba
      swirling.

  - title: Zhongli
    description: >- 
      Currently provides the strongest shield in the game with a
      Triple HP build. His kit also allows him to shred off Physical and
      Elemental RES which helps most team compositions Heizou can run.
