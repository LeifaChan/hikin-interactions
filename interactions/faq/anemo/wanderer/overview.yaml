  Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release
  (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
  Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little
  information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally,
  are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ
  should be taken with a grain of salt.

  - title: CHARACTER OVERVIEW
    description: >-
      Wanderer is an Anemo catalyst user who takes up the majority of the team’s
      field time in order to dish out high amounts of damage. This means that
      Wanderer teams will focus on having teammates that increase Wanderer’s
      damage values while taking little field time. 


      As for stats, Wanderer is a pretty standard unit to build, focusing on the
      traditional ATK, DMG%, and CRIT stats. While his ER needs are quite high,
      even with his dedicated support, Faruzan, and a Favonius weapon on the
      team, Wanderer can instead Burst every other rotation in order to put all
      of his artifact stats into offensive capabilities. In fact, this is his
      strongest option until constellations are added to him. Otherwise,
      Wanderer needs somewhere around 170% ER when C6 Faruzan is not included in
      the team – however, we do not expect players to have a new 4-star at C6
      the same patch they are released.


      When played as an Anemo DPS, he is heavily dependent on the new Anemo
      support, Faruzan, who brings Anemo resistance-shredding to the team, much
      like Viridescent Venerer does for Pyro, Electro, Cryo, and Hydro
      characters. Additionally, with constellations, she skyrockets the damage
      potential of teams focusing on Anemo DPS units like Wanderer and Xiao.


      Being an Anemo unit, some people may consider him another Viridescent
      Venerer driver for teams including characters like Fischl, Beidou, and
      Xingqiu. Additionally, focusing on Elemental Mastery for Swirls makes him
      comparable to Sucrose in some cases, but Wanderer lacks the utility in
      EM-sharing and crowd control that Sucrose has.


      One of the main highlights of Wanderer’s kit is that he can fly in mid-air
      while attacking enemies while also absorbing up to two elements for
      various buffs. Hovering in mid-air leaves Wanderer vulnerable to being
      knocked down and staggered by enemy attacks, so a shield may be desirable
      in some cases. Additionally, dodging when his A4 cannot trigger
      significantly reduces his air-time and thus his DPS. With regards to
      elemental buffs, they are quite hard to control, though the absorption
      priority is the same as Kazuha. If Bennett is on your team, Wanderer will
      almost always be able to absorb Pyro for a 30% ATK bonus. The other
      elements offer comparable damage increases, and so building your team
      around the infusions is (typically) not recommended.
