      His BiS artifact. The 4 piece effect is tailor made for Wanderer’s normal
      attack heavy playstyle. Being a catalyst character he does not suffer hit
      lag therefore attack speed is especially valuable for him. 10% attack
      speed from the set allows him to squeeze in an extra charged attack per
      rotation which is perfect for triggering the set effect, and it lasts his
      entire on-field time.

      A strong but slightly polarizing set. The extra attack is very appreciated
      by him. When bursting every *other* rotation this would be his second best
      choice. However when attempting to burst every rotation this set will
      suffer and be one of the worst, due to it making Wanderer more ER hungry
      and requiring extra ER subs.

      *Please checkout the mastersheet for detailed assumptions*


      Generally, the three combos are ranked in this order:

      **2PC Anemo DMG + 2PC Anemo DMG > 2PC Anemo DMG + 2PC ATK > 2PC ATK+2PC
      ATK**


      The difference between each combo is minimal, at most at around 4%. So if
      running one of these sets simply choose whichever has the better substats.

      A mediocre set for Wanderer. Depending if an attack speed buff is present
      or not, he is projected to proc the 4 piece effect for 5-6 times per
      rotation. This is not enough procs to contribute a significant amount to
      his overall damage per rotation.

      __*4PC Viridescent Venerer*__
    description: >-
      The set of choice when running him as a driver for reaction teams. However
      due to the reasons mentioned above he is not the most naturally suited
      character played as a driver. His personal damage with the 4 piece is
      decent, about 4-6% worse than 2PC ATK + 2PC ATK.

      A choice based on his great synergy with Bennett. With Bennett on the team
      the enemy is very likely to have pyro applied onto them, hence proccing
      the 4 piece’s set effect. The effect itself is comparable to 2PC Anemo DMG
      and 2PC Anemo DMG, winning over that combo by 5% extra DMG Bonus.

      An interesting set to use in freeze teams. Although given Wanderer is a
      Crit Rate ascending character, he is very likely to over-cap on that with
      the set’s 4 piece effect. And equipping 4 piece VV will be more beneficial
      for the overall team’s damage. Switch over to this set over 4 piece VV
      will only gain him marginal personal damage.
