      **Off-field DPS**
    description: >-
      Another way to increase team DPS aside from buffing Wanderer’s personal
      damage is to include an off-field DPS. Ironically, Wanderer does not
      provide much for these DPS units except for driving. Rather, it is Faruzan
      who supports these units by carrying the Viridescent Venerer set,
      providing grouping, and potentially through Favonius triggers. 

      It should be noted that many units under this category rely on their burst
      to dish out damage and will likely have high ER needs. To offset this,
      players can run a second unit of the same element to reduce ER needs or
      trade offensive stats for more ER. In the former case, Wanderer cannot
      absorb a secondary element through his A1 and thus loses a buff. In the
      latter scenario, the off-field DPS will of course lose significant damage
      and their place in the team becomes harder to justify. Alternatively, if
      the team consists of Bennett, the loss in damage can be mitigated.

      __**Yelan**__
    description: >-
      Has strong single target damage potential and can also buff
      Wanderer through her A4 passive which increases DMG% over time. On the
      downside, her ER requirements are quite high if played as solo hydro,
      significantly reducing her damage. Playing her with a secondary Hydro can
      alleviate this issue.

      Like Yelan, he has strong single target damage but high
      ER needs. He provides defensive utilities such as minor healing and
      interruption resistance.

  - title: __**Xiangling**__
    description: >-
      Even while Wanderer is in midair, Xiangling’s Pyronado
      can still hit enemies on the ground. She has strong AoE Pyro damage at the
      cost of high ER requirements. Recommended to play only with Bennett and
      potentially Favonius weapons.

  - title: __**Fischl**__
    description: >-
      Has strong off-field single target damage while being
      relatively low maintenance. Wanderer is not a bad driver for her and can
      trigger multiple instances of her A4 and C6, further increasing damage.

  - title: __**Beidou**__
    description: >-
      Specializes in AoE off-field damage. She offers
      interruption resistance via her burst as well as a small shield at C2,
      which Wanderer appreciates. However, she is greedy for energy and wants to
      be paired with Fischl to battery her.

  - title: __**Yae Miko**__
    description: >-
      Yae’s damage is split between her Elemental Skill and
      Elemental Burst. She does not need her burst to deal damage, but it is a
      significant portion of her DPS. Contratrily, her burst costs 90 energy,
      making it difficult to burst every rotation, and even if you can, it leads
      to rotation extension.

  - title: __**Ganyu**__
    description: >-
      Her burst can deal a fair amount of damage. With Faruzan’s
      grouping, she can take advantage of her burst’s targeting mechanics to
      deal even higher damage in AoE situations.

  - title: __**Rosaria**__
    description: >-
      Has solid damage output, especially with constellations.
      Also provides a partywide CRIT Rate buff with her passive.

  - title: __**Venti & Kazuha**__
    description: >-
      Many people play Venti and Kazuha as supports, and
      in doing so also forget that they have high talent multipliers. Because
      Wanderer wants to run Faruzan and Bennett, this means Venti or Kazuha will
      also benefit from their buffs, producing noticeable damage. In teams with
      Wanderer, they will function closer to a subdps than a support.
