      Since Wanderer only focuses on ATK, there is no necessity to level him to
      90. Level 80 is fine, if you’re saving on resources. However, incidental
      low-EM swirls will still be beneficial, so there are still some benefits
      to leveling to 90.


      Most of the damage Wanderer dishes out comes from Normal Attacks, which
      fire arcs of blade-like Anemo energy at opponents. Naturally, this is the
      first choice. However, his Normal Attacks are not nearly as strong unless
      he is benefitting from his Skill, which provides a valuable damage bonus
      akin to Yoimiya’s Skill to his attacks.


      Upon using his Skill, Wanderer will stay in air and will have an
      alternative stamina bar to for show how long he can stay in mid-air.
      Moving and sprinting will deplete the bar quickly, so often it is best to
      stay still in mid-air and unleash ranged attacks.


      Finally, while his Burst is not terrible, we *are* usually Bursting every
      other rotation, so this becomes the lowest priority. However, all talents
      should be leveled as high as possible, since he is responsible for the
      vast majority of your team’s damage. Wanderer’s Burst is pure damage, with
      no special effects, and hits opponents within its range five times in
      quick succession. 


      For Ascension Talents, A1 offers Wanderer up to two buffs based on
      elemental infusion with his Skill, depending on the elements absorbed. The
      priority is the same as Kazuha, making Pyro (+30% ATK) one of the two
      buffs most frequently. With Electro infused as well, Wanderer gains enough
      energy that, in some cases, Bursting off-cooldown becomes possible. Cryo
      gives 20% CRIT Rate, and Hydro increases the maximum amount of time he can
      spend in mid air (though keep in mind this could extend rotations
      depending on team composition). 


      None of the elements provide a buff greater than 10% of each other, and
      controlling the elemental infusion, aside from Pyro with Bennett’s Burst
      circle (and Hydro due to it being second-priority), is difficult, and so
      building a team around certain infusions is not always advised. For Hydro,
      Xingqiu’s orbiting Rain Swords can help with interruption resistance and
      Hydro infusion.


      Wanderer’s A4 allows *some* dashes to not consume this alternate flight
      stamina during the duration of his Skill; when this happens (based on RNG,
      increasing the odds with each failure like Royal weapons), a brief flurry
      of Anemo attacks will occur automatically, which can provide a valuable
      DPS boost. However, without testing, the fact dashes can still consume
      this alternate stamina and shorten the airborne state is often too large
      of a sacrifice to risk it, unless you *must* dash to avoid knockdown.
      **This, however, is subject to change with constellations and once actual
      testing can be done.**
