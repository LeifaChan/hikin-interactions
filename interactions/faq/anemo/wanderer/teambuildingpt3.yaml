    description: >-
      Wanderer prefers having a shielder support over a healer, if possible.
      This is because Wanderer has low interruption resistance even during his
      Windfavored state. He can get staggered midair, which is a DPS loss, but
      dodging without his A4 ready also depletes his secondary stamina bar and
      reduces his DPS uptime.

  - title: __**Layla**__
    description: >-
      Has a strong shield and allows Wanderer to gain 20% CRIT
      Rate through his A1. She is also a reliable Tenacity of the Millelith
      holder, and can buff Wanderer’s Normal and Charged Attacks at C4.

  - title: __**Diona**__
    description: >-
      Similar to Layla, but has a weaker shield and cannot hold
      Tenacity of the Millelith. On the contrary, she can heal.

      His shield is the strongest in the game while also
      providing a 20% universal resistance shred as well as 20% ATK from
      Tenacity of the Millelith. While not the best option, he is a good comfort
      pick with some buffs and debuffs in his kit.

  - title:  __**Thoma**__
    description: >-    
      Unlike the above shielders, Thoma relies on his burst to
      maintain uptime on his shield, which to some players may be a turnoff.
      Though his ER needs are demanding, his shield is reliable. He can provide
      a 30% ATK buff through Wanderer’s A1 passive and potentially complete Pyro
      resonance for 25% ATK. His C6 also confers 15% DMG to Normal and Charged
      attacks.

  - title:  __**Jean**__
    description: >-    
      A decent healing option. With Faruzan’s buffs and lowered ER
      requirements, she can build into damage, although note she is not
      particularly impressive at C0. If Bennett is on the team, her damage can
      become significant via his ATK buff and her Sunfire tech. At C2, she
      provides a 15% ATK Speed buff, and shreds Anemo resistance by 40% at C4,
      boosting Wanderer’s damage by a significant margin.

  - title:  __**Kokomi**__
    description: >-  
      Heals while holding Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and
      Tenacity of the Millelith for a total of a 68% ATK buff, and also gives
      Hydro absorption for Wanderer’s A1.

  - title: __**Do I need a battery for Wanderer?**__
    description: >-
      No. Most of Wanderer’s damage output comes from his Normal Attacks. While
      his burst deals a good amount of damage and should be used if possible, it
      is not the main feature of his kit.
