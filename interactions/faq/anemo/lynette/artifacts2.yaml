      **4PC Viridescent Venerer**
  description: >-
    Like most other Anemo supports / Sub-DPSes, Viridescent Venerer is
    Lynette’s Best-in-Slot set, performing extremely well when compared to
    other sets. When comparing sets for her solo DPS, 4pc VV is only
    outperformed marginally <0-4%>  in certain niche team comps. When
    comparing it to other sets for her team’s overall DPS, 4pc VV easily beats
    all other sets due to the excellent debuff it inflicts, allowing her
    swirls to reduce the enemy’s resistance based on the element swirled by
    40%.

- title: '**4PC Emblem of Severed Fate**'
  description: >-
    Due to Lynette’s relatively high ER Requirements at C0, as well as most of
    her damage coming from her Burst, 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate is her
    highest personal damage Artifact set. This set can be an option for
    off-field playstyles or before C6 in teams that don’t gain a lot from
    Viridescent Venerer.

- title: '**4PC Gilded Dreams**'
  description: >-
    An option not too far behind for personal damage whilst giving a mix of
    ATK% and EM. This set excels when using Lynette as a driver for Hyperbloom
    when built with 3 EM main stats.

- title: '**4PC Flower of Paradise Lost**'
  description: >-
    An option over Gilded Dreams that grants slightly more Hyperbloom damage
    in exchange for lower Swirl and Aggravate damage.

- title: '**4PC Marechaussee Hunter**'
  description: >-
    Due to Lynette’s Skill healing and then slowly draining her HP, she is
    able to activate the 4pc effect of Marechaussee Hunter, granting her large
    amounts of CRIT Rate. However, as the set only procs on-field, the stacks
    will not stay for her Burst’s whole duration unless she is played on-field
    at C6.

- title: '**4PC Desert Pavilion Chronicle**'
  description: >-
    A set only recommended at C6, due to providing 40% Normal, Charged and
    Plunging Attack DMG after hitting an enemy with a Charged Attack. With the
    2pc effect granting extra DMG%, it is another option Lynette can use to
    further boost her personal damage.

- title: '**4PC Noblesse Oblige**'
  description: >-
    If there is not already a Noblesse user on the team, Lynette doesn’t lose
    too much from running it, as her personal damage isn’t high in most teams.
    However, it is recommended to use 4pc VV instead for team buffs if there
    is no other 4pc VV user on the team.

    reach ER requirements.
