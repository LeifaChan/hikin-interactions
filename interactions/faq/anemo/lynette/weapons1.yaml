      Due to Lynette’s three potential playstyles, it’s important to clarify
      that the rankings will be vastly different depending on your ideal
      playstyle. 


      General-Use playstyles require Energy Recharge weapons in order to meet
      Energy requirements. CRIT weapons cannot reach 220+% in KQMC standards,
      which severely limits your options.


      An3mo playstyles as an on-field DPS prefer CRIT weapons, due to her much
      lower Energy requirements.


      Hyperbloom playstyles prefer Energy Recharge or Elemental Mastery weapons,
      since she will be triggering the Hyperbloom reactions. Keep in mind that
      Favonius Sword overshoots her energy needs in this team.

      __Recommended for General Use (C0+; National, Freeze, etc.)__

      **Favonius Sword**
    description: >-
      The best all-around weapon for Lynette, decreasing her own as well as her
      teammates’ Energy requirements. Do keep in mind that without building CRIT
      Rate, you might find some difficulty in triggering its passive
      consistently.

  - title: '**Sapwood Blade**'
    description: >-
      A solid craftable option that can boost a character’s Elemental Mastery
      for a short time. Only opt for this over Favonius Sword  when energy needs
      are quite comfortable across the team, but this is still a potent option
      in some circumstances.

  - title: '**Sacrificial Sword**'
    description: >-
      Offers less general batterying than Favonius Sword in exchange for more
      Anemo particles created. If the trigger on the passive occurs, it solves
      100% of Lynette’s Energy Recharge requirements, but since it maxes out at
      an 80% chance at R5, this is not guaranteed. It can also situationally add
      time to Lynette’s rotation.

    description: >-
      This weapon is almost purely an Energy Recharge stick, but it solves
      almost all of Lynette’s Energy requirements.

  - title: '**Amenoma Kageuchi**'
    description: >-
      Another sword that mainly exists to provide Energy. It has no other
      special uses.

  - title: '**Festering Desire R5**'
    description: >-
      Energy Recharge stick. The extra CRIT Rate on Skill uses and Skill DMG
      isn’t much of a boon.

    description: >-
      Not to be confused with the 5-Star Skyward Blade, though the two perform
      similarly. This is the barebones 3-star option.
