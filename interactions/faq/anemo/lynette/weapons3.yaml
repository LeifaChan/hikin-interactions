      **Freedom-Sworn**
    description: >-
      The obvious 5-star choice for an EM sword-wielder. It provides a ton of
      Elemental Mastery while also buffing the team. The bonus to her Normal,
      Charged, and Plunging Attack damage isn’t a significant boost, but it is
      well-appreciated.

      If you want something that performs similarly to Freedom Sworn but don’t
      want to wish for a 5-star weapon, Xiphos Moonlight is a great choice. It
      also acts as a pseudo-Favonius weapon by increasing the team’s’ Energy
      Recharge. R5 has no impact on personal damage performance compared to R3,
      but the Energy Recharge buff to the party will be greater at higher
      refinements.

      Best craftable for her personal damage while also outranking other
      options, including other 5-star weapons. There’s not much to say about
      this, other than it is a solid stat stick.

      This craftable does less damage, but can offer a leaf that buffs Elemental
      Mastery. This is probably better on support builds, but is still worth
      mentioning.
