      **Ascension 1 Passive: Sophisticated Energy**
    description: >-
      After using her Burst, based on the amount of different elements in the
      team, Lynette will give a teamwide ATK boost. Pure Anemo offers 8%,
      whereas a 3 Anemo team gets 12%. The most common distribution (three
      elements) offers 16%, and in a rainbow team (all different elements), the
      passive gives 20%. This buff lasts for 10s.

      Once Lynette's Elemental Burst absorbs an element, it gains a 15% DMG
      Bonus for the rest of its duration. This helps increase the damage
      provided by her Burst and scales in usefulness depending on how quickly
      you can cause it to absorb an element.

      Lynette shows the location of Recovery Orbs on the minimap whilst
      underwater and increases the HP and stamina gained from these by 25%,
      letting players explore Fontaine's new underwater areas more easily.
