    description: >-
      *CD : **18s**

      Energy Cost : **70***


      Lynette hits around her in an AoE whilst summoning a **Bogglecat Box**,
      which taunts enemies and deals Anemo DMG every second. When the Bogglecat
      Box is hit by a Cryo, Pyro, Hydro or Electro attack, it absorbs the
      element and starts firing **Vivid Shots**, one every 2.3 seconds.


      Her Burst is her highest source of damage, lasting for 12 seconds on an 18
      second cooldown with a 70 Energy Cost. It has similar properties to other
      abilities in the game, such as Amber’s Baron Bunny, in which it can be
      pushed around easily by players and enemies. The Bogglecat Box also shares
      the same absorption rules as Dendro Traveler, absorbing the first Element
      it comes into contact with. With C2, the Elemental application from her
      Vivid Shots doubles to once every wave, compared to once every other wave,
      allowing her to trigger more reactions against enemies. Her Burst is also
      dynamic, meaning buffs such as Marechaussee Hunter will grant all 3 stacks
      to her Burst, rather than snapshotting 1 or 2 stacks upon casting.
