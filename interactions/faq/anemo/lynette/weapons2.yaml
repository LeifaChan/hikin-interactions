      **Mistsplitter Reforged (N1 after E)**
    description: >-
      The best-in-slot for Lynette’s damage by far, assuming full stacks and an
      infused N1 immediately after her Skill use. When buffed by C6 Faruzan and
      C5 or below Bennett, she can almost scratch 15k DPS within her 6-7s field
      time. About 10% greater than the next best option in terms of damage.

  - title: '**Primordial Jade Cutter**'
    description: >-
      A generically good CRIT weapon for almost anyone, giving her a whopping
      44% CRIT Rate and an extra bit of HP from its passive, along with extra
      attack based on her Max HP. Lynette doesn’t care as much about her HP
      stat, but it’s useful for the CRIT Rate regardless.

  - title: '**Haran Geppaku Futsu**'
    description: >-
      Another solid option. Lynette can use the passive quite well with her
      infusion.

  - title: '**Light of Foliar Incision (N1 after E)**'
    description: >-
      Another CRIT stick. The passive is nice to have but doesn't provide a
      meaningful increase due to Lynette generally building for ATK and CRIT
      rather than EM.

  - title: '**Wolf-Fang R5**'
    description: >-
      The dynamic-buffing CRIT Rate is useful on both her Skill and Burst, and
      offers surprising damage potential as a 4-star weapon.

  - title: '**The Black Sword R5**'
    description: >-
      A solid CRIT Rate weapon obtainable through Battle Pass. The Normal and
      Charged Attack damage buff is very much appreciated when Lynette is
      attacking in An3mo teams. The lifegain is a nice bonus but inessential.
      Many players already have a few of these already if they’re a regular
      Battle-Pass renewer.

  - title: '**Other 5-Star Swords besides Aquila and Key**'
    description: >-
      There isn’t much to say about other weapons other than “they do decent
      damage.” This includes Freedom Sworn, Summit Shaper, and Skyward Blade.

  - title: '**Amenoma Kageuchi R5**'
    description: >-
      The best craftable option for damage, lessening Lynette’s Energy needs in
      An3mo teams even further. This allows Lynette to invest almost purely into
      damage. Lion’s Roar R5 can tie if you can maintain 100% passive uptime.
