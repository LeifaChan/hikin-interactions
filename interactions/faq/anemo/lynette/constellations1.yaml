      __CONSTELLATIONS__

      **Constellation 1 - A Cold Blade Like a Shadow**
    description: >-
      > *When Enigmatic Feint's Enigma Thrust hits an opponent with Shadowsign,
      a vortex will be created at that opponent's position that will pull nearby
      opponents in.*


      Grants Lynette some extra utility in the form of grouping. The grouping is
      about the same size as Sucrose/Faruzan’s Skill grouping whilst having the
      same pull speed as Kazuha’s Skill. The grouping also lasts long enough to
      actually pull light enemies together, making it quite reliable.
      Unfortunately, it only activates upon hitting an opponent with her Hold
      Skill rather than Tap or Hold, and with her Skill’s relatively easy chance
      to miss even when locked on, you’ll need to be careful when using it.

      fires a Vivid Shot, it will fire an extra Vivid Shot.*


      A rather nice Constellation, increasing the Elemental Application from her
      Vivid Shots to once every wave rather than once every other wave. This
      effectively doubles the amount of reactions from her Elemental Burst and
      can be especially useful in Hyperbloom teams upon swirling Electro,
      allowing for easy off-field Hyperbloom triggers.
