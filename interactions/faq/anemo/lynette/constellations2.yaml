      Three extra levels to Lynette’s Skill, granting her slightly more damage.
      Her damage contribution, however, isn’t massive to begin with.

      Lynette makes quite good use of an extra Skill charge, allowing her to
      frontload Anemo Particles, doubles her grouping potential and lets her fit
      20-second rotations, where she alternates between 1 and 2 Skill casts per
      rotation. Keep in mind, her Ousia-aligned Arkhe Attack only triggers once
      every 10 seconds, meaning she will only send out one Arkhe Attack if you
      use two Skills back to back. In 20s rotations, she essentially gains one
      extra skill use every *other* rotation. In 25s rotations, she can maintain
      her Anemo infusion for over 10s.
