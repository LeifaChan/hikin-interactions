      Three extra levels to Lynette’s Burst, granting more damage from both the
      Bogglecat Box and Vivid Shots. However, like her Constellation 3, her
      damage contribution to the team isn’t massive.

      Anemo Infusion and 20% Anemo DMG Bonus for 6s.*


      Her last Constellation grants a new playstyle to Lynette, allowing her to
      take the field for a portion of your rotation, whilst also gaining a 20%
      Anemo DMG Bonus, increasing the damage from the rest of her kit. This
      Constellation allows her to drive teams such as Hyperbloom, where EM stats
      can be valuable compared to her traditional ADC build. The increased field
      time also lowers her Energy requirements, allowing more offensive substats
      in her gear. Anemo Infusions also allow for Lynette to swirl other
      infusions off her weapon, allowing for unique double swirl setups with
      other infusions such as C6 Bennett, Chongyun or Candace.
