      ### **Lynette | Faruzan | Anemo | Flex**

      Due to Lynette being an Anemo character that generally builds for ATK and
      CRIT over EM stats, she finds a nice place in An3mo. Bennett is highly
      recommended for the flex slot of this team due to the large attack buff he
      brings on top of general survivability. However, he must be C5 or lower,
      due to Lynette’s infusion being swirled away by the Pyro Infusion granted
      by his Burst. C6 Faruzan is also another large increase, lowering her and
      the team's ER requirements whilst also dealing good off-field damage,
      allowing C6 Lynette or another Anemo character to take the field.

      ### **Lynette C6 | Electro | Hydro | Dendro**

      With Lynette’s C6 granting an Anemo Infusion, she is able to drive
      on-field in Hyperbloom teams, constantly swirling Electro with her
      Elemental Burst and Normal Attacks to trigger Aggravate and Hyperblooms.
      Although Electro is last in her Burst Absorption priority, it grants more
      Hyperblooms than a Hydro Absorption due to characters like Xingqiu and
      Yelan having high enough Hydro Application to wipe Quicken Auras. Nahida
      and Baizhu are options, but both come with their own detriments that make
      them worth reconsidering. First, Nahida’s 1.5U Dendro application on her
      Skill, whilst also applying on the triggering of reactions can remove
      Electro Auras from enemies. This interferes with Swirl reactions to
      consistently trigger Hyperblooms. Second, Baizhu’s application may be good
      enough for Quicken teams, but cannot generate sufficient Dendro Cores as
      the sole Dendro applicator in Hyperbloom. Yaoyao is an alternative if
      players need a Dendro healer but performs better in AoE scenarios compared
      to Single-Target due to the random targeting on her Skill. Kuki is another
      viable option due to consolidating both healing and great Hyperbloom
      triggers, but leads to Lynette feeling out of place, not getting many
      Swirls or Hyperblooms.
