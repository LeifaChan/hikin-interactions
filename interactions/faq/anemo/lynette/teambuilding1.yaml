      At C0, Lynette leans much more to a general Anemo slot in for teams,
      especially against Pneuma-aligned enemies and mechanics. Her Skill gives
      short but fast mobility whilst her Burst gives fast, off-field Anemo DMG.
      With constellations, she gains grouping, increased Absorption application,
      an extra Skill charge and an Anemo Infusion, granting her more utility and
      flexibility.


      However, due to her skill being Single-Target and having a tendency to
      miss both the initial hit and Ousia follow-up, she may struggle to
      actually annihilate Arkhe mechanics. 


      Lynette’s field time varies depending on your build and team:

      - **General Use**: 2-4s

      - **An3mo**: 6-7s; when Normal Attacking with infusion, N2C is best for
      damage.

      - **Hyperbloom**: 6-7s+6-7s or 12-13s (whether you infuse two separate
      times, or use all your field time at once); when Normal Attacking with
      infusion, N3D is best for Swirl count.
