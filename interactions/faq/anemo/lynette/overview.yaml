          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions. 

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Lynette is a 4-star Anemo Sword character who is the first “Ousia-aligned”
      character to be released in the Fontaine era of Genshin Impact. While the
      Ousia alignment on her Skill can help solve puzzles and exploit boss
      weaknesses, she is a support character who can buff her teammates with a
      pseudo-Noblesse Oblige set on one of her passives. With all six
      Constellations, she can infuse her sword with Anemo upon using her Skill
      and can deal modest damage with the help of Faruzan and Bennett.


      At C0, her team options are quite restrictive; National teams may struggle
      with Lynette due to her Burst application interfering with Xiangling’s
      reaction triggers, leaving her only able to use her low-power Skill before
      switching out. Her other potentially viable playstyles are locked behind
      her C6, which allows her to drive with Anemo infusion. However, with C6,
      she can be the trigger for Hyperbloom reactions if you have an Electro
      character who fails to hit Dendro cores like Fischl.


      That said, the majority of the time, Lynette will serve as a dedicated
      support, rather than a DPS. 


      Compared to other Viridescent Venerer-wielders, Lynette falls behind.
      While her Burst taunts enemies, her crowd control is severely lacking
      compared to Sucrose, another 4-star Anemo character. In Hyperbloom teams,
      Sucrose remains a stronger option due to her being able to share her
      Elemental Mastery stat, whereas Lynette’s teamwide ATK buff is less
      relevant, and Sucrose’s Anemo application is not dependent on an infusion
      like Lynette, offering Sucrose more consistency. For raw damage in An3mo
      teams, 4-star Heizou is a fierce competition and doesn’t need to rely on
      an infusion through max Constellations to deal respectable Anemo damage. 


      To summarize, Lynette is seldom the best choice for any circumstance
      outside of being an Anemo character with the Ousia alignment. When it
      comes to support, ATK damage, and reactions, other 4-stars and 5-stars are
      more efficient at their jobs. Lynette’s true power evaluation, then,
      depends on exactly how essential Ousia alignment becomes from 4.0 onward.
