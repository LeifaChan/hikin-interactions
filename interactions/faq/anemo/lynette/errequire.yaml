  - title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
    description: >-
      Lynette’s Energy requirements are quite high without a plethora of support
      through Favonius weapons and Anemo teammates. In 25s rotations and an
      Energy-rich team, these requirements plummet, though longer rotations will
      mainly be useful only when Lynette’s infusion at C6 is unlocked. However,
      even at C0, she has a 12s cooldown on her Skill, which allows her to use
      it twice per long rotation.


      We tested Energy Recharge requirements for teams grouped into three
      categories: *General Use* (National, Freeze, etc.), *An3mo* (C6 Lynette
      with C6 Faruzan and Kazuha), and *Hyperbloom* teams (Collei/DMC/Nahida,
      Xingqiu, and Fischl, C6 Lynette is the trigger).


      ### **General Use**

      National (1 Fav on Team) - 230%

      National (1 Fav + Lynette Fav) - 180%

      Freeze (1 Fav on Team) - 220%

      Freeze (1 Fav + Lynette Fav) - 180%

      ### **An3mo (C6 Lynette)**

      No Fav - 150%

      1 Fav - 140%

      2 Fav - 135%

      ### **Hyperbloom (C6 Lynette)**

      *ER needs will vary slightly depending on how consistently you can keep Oz
      up (whether you Burst every rotation or slightly desync) and which Dendro
      character you use between Collei, DMC, and Nahida)*


      Collei 1E, No Fav - 155-160%

      Collei 2E, No Fav - 145%-155%

      Collei 1E + Fav - 140%-150%

      Collei 2E + Fav - 135%-145%

      DMC 1E + Fav - 145%-150%

      DMC 2E + Fav - 140%-145%

      Nahida, No Fav - 135%-145%



      Lynette’s Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation.
