      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Rapid Ritesword**
    description: >-
      Lynette performs a quick, 4-hit attack string with a multihit on the 3rd
      attack. At C0, these are underwhelming due to Lynette not being suited for
      Physical DMG, but her C6 grants a short Anemo Infusion, allowing her to
      have some on-field presence.

      *CD : **12s***


      Lynette’s Skill has both a Tap and Hold function. On Tap, Lynette
      unleashes **Enigma Thrust**, thrusting forward with her sword. Once Enigma
      Thrust hits an opponent, Lynette will restore 25% of her Max HP and then
      proceed to lose 6% of her Max HP every second for 4 seconds.


      On Hold, Lynette enters the **Pilfering Shadow** state, increasing her
      Movement SPD for 2.5 seconds. During this state, a **Shadowsign** mark
      will appear over a nearby enemy, which marks the enemy Lynette will target
      upon ending her Skill, where she will then perform the same Enigma Thrust
      as her Tap Skill. 


      When Lynette unleashes an Enigma Thrust, she will also activate her Arkhe
      Attack, **Surging Blade**, dealing Ousia-aligned Anemo DMG to the enemy
      hit, and has a cooldown of once every 10 seconds. Arkhe Attacks do not
      apply an element and deal very little damage, however, it will cause an
      Annihilation reaction when coming into contact with the opposite Arkhe
      energy. At this point in time, Lynette is our only source of Ousia-aligned
      attacks, giving her a possible role against Pneuma-aligned enemies or
      mechanics.


      Lynette’s Skill generates 4 Anemo particles on a 12 second cooldown,
      allowing her to generate a large amount of particles in a short period
      with C4 or Sacrificial Sword. However, the cooldown on her Skill alongside
      her high Burst cost results in her having relatively high Energy
      requirements when played off-field. Unfortunately, as of the time of
      writing, both Lynette’s Arkhe Attack and her Skill also have a tendency to
      whiff on enemies, making gaining particles and annihilating against
      Pneuma-aligned enemies cumbersome.
