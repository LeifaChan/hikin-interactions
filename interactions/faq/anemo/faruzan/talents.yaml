- title: 'Analysis:'
  description: "Part of Faruzan’s kit increases Anemo damage by 32% of her base attack,
    so leveling her to at least 80/90 is recommended. Leveling her to 90 would maximize
    this buff that is based off her base attack, which is only increased by level
    and weapon. \n\nFaruzan’s Normal Attacks do not deal a great amount of damage
    and her Charge Attack damage mainly comes from her Elemental Skill. Most of her
    kit is focused around her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.\n\nWhen pressing
    her Elemental Skill, she will deal AOE Anemo Damage to nearby opponents and enter
    her Manifest Gale state. When in this state, her next fully charged arrow will
    apply Pressurized Collapse to enemies hit by the AOE. It causes light CC to nearby
    enemies, provides a fixed 30% Anemo RES decrease to enemies from her A1 and deals
    Anemo damage to enemies hit. This part of her kit provides decent grouping for
    small enemies that can make it easier for your Anemo DPS to target them. \n\nFaruzan’s
    Elemental Burst releases an Anemo Shape that moves in a triangular path on the
    field. When used, it reduces enemies Anemo RES by 30% while also boosting Anemo
    damage of nearby party members by 30.6% at Talent level 9. This is the most important
    part of her kit, providing herself and the Anemo DPS on the team with pretty good
    buffs. Recommend leveling this talent first over any of the others. \n\nHer 1st
    Ascension Talent reduces the time taken to charge a shot by 60% for her Charge
    Attack of her arrow after using her elemental skill. Also reducing enemies with
    the 30% Anemo RES on enemies hit by the Charge Attack’s AOE. Think of it like
    Sara’s A1 and Charge Attack after using her Elemental Skill. Decent A1 which helps
    boost her team’s damage outside of her burst. \n\nFaruzan’s 4th Ascension is when
    your characters deal Anemo damage while under the effects of Faruzan’s Elemental
    Burst, their Anemo damage is boosted by 32% of Faruzan’s Base Attack. While this
    isn’t the biggest damage increase (Especially if already pairing your Anemo DPS
    with an external attack buff like Bennett), it does still help overall. Leveling
    your weapon to 90 and leveling Faruzan to at least 80/90 should maximize this
    A4. \n\nLastly, her overworld Passive Talent is the basic expedition talent which
    gains an extra 25% of materials when dispatched in Sumeru for 20 hours."
