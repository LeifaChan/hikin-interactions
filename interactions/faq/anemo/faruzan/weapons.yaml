    Due to her enormously high ER requirement before C6, the weapon options are quite limited here; some of them make 2pc Emblem/Exile mandatory on her, thus may reduce teamâ€™s damage without 4pc Viridescent Venerer effect. At C6, she can choose more offensive options to increase her personal damage without worrying too much about her energy problem

  description: Arguably her Best-in-Slot 4* weapon; it lowers her ER requirement with
    the particles provided by its passive. Also allow her to use 4pc Viridescent Venerer
    without compromising the ER needed.

- title: Offensive Options
  description: Only use them if you have Faruzan at Constellation 6, where her ER
    requirements are much more acceptable. All of them are pretty similar in strength
    therefore any option will do.
