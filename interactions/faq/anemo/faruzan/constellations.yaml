    **C1 - Truth By Any Means**
  description: 'Gives her the ability to fire two Hurricane Arrows when you use fully
    charged aimed shots, but only after you use her Skill, *Wind Realm of Nasamjnin*.
    Normally, you do not want to fire both of them twice due to energy ICD, which
    will not generate another instance of Energy with the second consecutive second
    shot; rather than that, the second Arrow should only be used when you miss the
    first shot. Rating: 1/5'

  description: 'The polyhedron that is created during her burst stays for 6 seconds
    more on the field. A moderate constellation which can extend the rotation to around
    22 seconds without losing its uptime. Rating: 2/5'

    better with her Constellation 6. Rating: 1/5'

  description: 'The vortex that is created by pressurized collapse gives her energy
    particles based on how many opponents it hits, minimum of 2 energy and 0.5 per
    extra enemy, up to 4. This Constellation alone does not solve her energy problem,
    but combined with C6 will. Rating: 2/5'

    and her own damage. Rating: 2.5/5'

- title: "**C6 - The Wondrous Path of Truth **"
  description: 'Characters that are in her burst’s field and obtain the Prayerful
    Wind’s Benefit will have their crit damage increase by 40% if they happen to deal
    Anemo damage, while also apply Pressurized Collapsed to the enemy. Not only does
    it improve the main Anemo carry damage, it also lowers both of their energy issues
    by triggering Pressurized Collapsed that deals more damage from C3, restore energies
    to Faruzan with C4 and generate Anemo particles overtime.  Rating: 6/5'
