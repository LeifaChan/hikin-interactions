  description: Her kit excels at giving buffs to Anemo characters and Anemo RES Shred
    to the enemies, therefore she should be paired with some of the Anemo main carries
    that are available at the moment.

    **Wanderer / Xiao / Heizou - Faruzan - Bennett/Flex - Flex**

    Pairing anyone of those 3 above with Faruzan is essential to bring out their maximum potential. The last 2 slots can be anyone that either brings more to the team or the main carry: *Bennett*, *Zhongli*, *Yelan*, *Fischl*, â€¦ Do note that in teams that have a sub DPS like *Yelan* or *Xingqiu*, pairing her with 4pc Viridescent Venerer should be prioritized to enhance their damage.

- title: "**Overall Anemo support**"
  description: As an Anemo character, she has access to 4pc Viridescent Venerer, which
    is useful overall. Therefore, she can technically fit in as the flex slot just
    for the 4VV effect and ignore her energy problem by not Bursting every rotation.
    However, she is not recommended because there exist other Anemo characters that
    either have more utilities or deal more damage than her.
