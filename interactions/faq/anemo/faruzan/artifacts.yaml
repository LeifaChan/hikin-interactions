    Artifacts will be dependent on what team composition you will run Faruzan with the proper Anemo DPS and other supports that provide other utilities compared to Faruzan.

    **Timepiece: ER%** - This consolidates her ER needs and with Favonius Warbow, reaches that requirement fairly easily along with 1-2 ER distributed subs.

    **Goblet: Anemo DMG%** - Strictly to push out damage from her kit overall

    **Circlet: CR%** - With Favonius Warbow, CR% is mandatory for its passive to trigger consistently while allowing Faruzan to proc CRITS for her damage as well.

    ***Substat Priority: ER% (Until requirement is reached) > 
    
    CR%=CDMG% > ATK%***

    4PC Viridescent Venerer
  description: This artifact set excels at providing RES Shred for the off-field DMG
    that the other units provide for the Anemo DPS. It also amps up Faruzan’s overall
    DMG but not to a significant degree compared to the other artifact sets

- title: 4PC Noblesse Oblige
  description: Standard support artifact set. Quick and easy to use for Faruzan and
    generally helps the Anemo DPS deal more DMG and works well with a dynamic off-field
    DMG.

- title: 4PC The Exile
  description: With Faruzan’s ER Requirement needing to be high, this artifact set
    stands out from the rest as not only her ER Requirement lowers, it also lowers
    the entire parties, consolidating the ER subs to a much more offensive distribution
    for DMG. Faruzan would want the off-piece to be a 5* ER% Timepiece with this set.

- title: 4PC Emblem of Severed Fate
  description: Along with Exile, this set consolidates with her ER Requirement but
    provides a much more offensive attribute from its 4PC passive to Faruzan only.

    4PC Tenacity of the Millelith
  description: Only viable when Faruzan is at C6 due to its extra Collapse being able
    to maintain the ATK% Buff throughout the entire Anemo DPS on-field time.
