- title: __**CHARACTER OVERVIEW**__
  description: "Faruzan is a 4* Anemo bow user whose kit revolves around buffing her
    team's Anemo damage while decreasing the enemies Anemo resistance. This allows
    her to serve as the staple support for a team with an Anemo DPS. \n\nFor stats,
    Energy Recharge is the most important stat on her. With her 80 energy cost, her
    ER requirements on her teams can reach extremely high levels. As her Energy requirements
    are quite high, Favonius Warbow is often recommended to be able to use her Elemental
    Burst off cooldown and continually support the Anemo DPS. ER sands, Anemo DMG%
    Goblet and CRIT% circlet can be used, CRIT Rate% becoming even more important
    with Favonius Warbow as her weapon.\n\nWhile her Elemental Skill can provide light
    crowd control for small enemies, the main part of her kit is her Elemental Burst,
    which provides the buffs for her Anemo DPS teammate. At C0 she is a serviceable
    Anemo DPS support that can be used. Her C1 allows her to use a second charged
    arrow after using her Skill. C2 increases her Burst length by 6 seconds to a total
    of 18. C4 allows her to gain more energy for the amount of characters hit by her
    Elemental Skill’s Charge Attack. C5 is notable since it adds 3 levels to her Elemental
    Burst, which boosts the Anemo damage bonus she gives. While her C2, C4 and C5
    are decent, her C6 drastically improves her. Her C6 both adds CRIT Damage to Anemo
    attacks and significantly boosts her support capabilities for the team and herself,
    while reducing her ER% requirements for herself."
