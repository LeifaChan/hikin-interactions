      "description": "Faruzan’s particle generation relies on her hitting her Hurricane Arrow to the enemies and waiting for Pressurized Collapse to trigger, meaning she will rely on a specific combo of E CA Q to funnel the particle to herself or E Q CA to funnel the energy to the Anemo DPS. Generally, funneling energy to another party member is not ideal for Faruzan due to her particles generation being 2 per CA so her ER Requirement would be high. Typically, __**220%+ ER Requirement**__ solidifies her need to cast Burst every rotation with Favonius Warbow and without it, her ER skyrockets to a degree in which the KQMC distributed subs cannot reach.",

At C6, she can choose more offensive options to increase her personal damage without worrying too much about her energy problem\n\n*For more explicit number and ranking, please check out the mastersheet*",
