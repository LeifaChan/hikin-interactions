- title: __**ER REQUIREMENT**__
  description: Faruzanâ€™s particle generation relies on her hitting her Hurricane Arrow
    to the enemies and waiting for Pressurized Collapse to trigger, meaning she will
    rely on a specific combo of E CA Q to funnel the particle to herself or E Q CA
    to funnel the energy to the Anemo DPS. Generally, funneling energy to another
    party member is not ideal for Faruzan due to her particles generation being 2
    per CA so her ER Requirement would be high. Typically, __**220%+ ER Requirement**__
    solidifies her need to cast Burst every rotation with Favonius Warbow and without
    it, her ER skyrockets to a degree in which the KQMC distributed subs cannot reach.
