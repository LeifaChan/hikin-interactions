      Wanderer’s weapons depend on your team; most notably, they depend on
      whether he is being supported by Bennett or not, as Bennett’s massive Flat
      ATK buff devalues ATK% weapons.


      Here I will list the main recommendations from the signature weapon to the
      most efficient freely accessible weapon. However, for a more complete idea
      of weapon rankings, please refer to the mastersheet included here, make a
      copy of it, and play with the filters to examine the relationships with
      buffs in more detail.

  - title: 1. Tullaytullah’s Remembrance - Limited Signature Weapon
    description: >-
      It gives CRIT DMG and ATK SPD, which makes it a good stat stick by itself
      for Wanderer, while also providing an extremely valuable 48% DMG bonus on
      Normal Attacks. While this buff takes time to ramp up, Wanderer can
      quickly ramp the buff to its maximum potential. It is consistently between
      10-15% stronger than the next best option, but declines with buffs
      compared to N2C weapons.

      2. Memory of Dust (w/o Benny) // Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds (w/
      Benny)
    description: >-
      a. A shield for Memory of Dust is valuable, but does not affect the
      weapon’s ranking (shielded is 2nd place, unshielded is third). It’s a
      natural fit for Wanderer since he attacks so rapidly.


      b. Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds finally has a home; we have not yet had
      a catalyst-wielding DPS who values CRIT and spends lots of time on-field.
      Wanderer fits the bill.

  - title: 3. Skyward Atlas (w/o Benny) // Kagura’s Verity (w/ Benny)
    description: >-
      a. Atlas is generically strong on almost any catalyst-user who values ATK,
      and Wanderer is no exception. The passive is straightforward, so there’s
      not much to say here.


      b. Kagura’s Verity was calced without regard for the passive, due to
      Wanderer only using his Skill one per rotation. It ranks this high purely
      because of its CRIT DMG stat and high ATK.

  - title: 4. Widsith // Solar Pearl
    description: >-
      Widsith and Solar Pearl are, on Normal Attacking catalyst-users, quite
      close in terms of damage. Widsith scores higher than Solar Pearl and has
      higher spikes in damage, even when averaged across two rotations. Wanderer
      does not quite benefit from the Elemental Mastery buff, often feeling
      close-to-wasted on him and leading to Abyss floor resets. Solar Pearl is
      the consistent option for lower damage.

  - title: 5. Dodoco Tales (Event Weapon)
    description: >-
      This event weapon made for Klee is surprisingly strong on Wanderer on a
      modified rotation. Since Wanderer’s Charged Attacks are quick to execute,
      he spam them while only Normal Attacking once every few seconds to
      maintain the buff. Without Benny, this weapon on its specialized rotation
      surpasses the weapons in “Tier 3” of this section.

  - title: Blackcliff Agate (Paimon’s Bargains)
    description: >-
      Even when not counting any stacks, this is at least respectable for pure
      F2P players, and beats out Mappa Mare by a good amount even at R1. Think
      of the ATK bonus as just an occasional buff to an OK weapon, since some
      floors of Spiral Abyss only have one enemy, making it impossible to
      trigger.

  - title: Frostbearer (Craftable)
    description: >-
      Frostbearer is a generic ATK%-scaling weapon that is best when Bennett is
      not on the team. For Bennett teams, Mappa Mare at high refinement offers a
      desirable damage bonus.
