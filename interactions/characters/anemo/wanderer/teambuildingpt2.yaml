  - title: '**Off-field DPS**'
    description: >-
      Another way to increase team DPS aside from buffing Wanderer’s personal
      damage is to include an off-field DPS. Ironically, Wanderer does not
      provide much for these DPS units except for driving. Rather, it is Faruzan
      who supports these units by carrying the Viridescent Venerer set,
      providing grouping, and potentially through Favonius triggers. 


      It should be noted that many units under this category rely on their burst
      to dish out damage and will likely have high ER needs. To offset this,
      players can run a second unit of the same element to reduce ER needs or
      trade offensive stats for more ER. In the former case, Wanderer cannot
      absorb a secondary element through his A1 and thus loses a buff. In the
      latter scenario, the off-field DPS will of course lose significant damage
      and their place in the team becomes harder to justify. Alternatively, if
      the team consists of Bennett, the loss in damage can be mitigated. 


      __**Yelan**__: Has strong single target damage potential and can also buff
      Wanderer through her A4 passive which increases DMG% over time. On the
      downside, her ER requirements are quite high if played as solo hydro,
      significantly reducing her damage. Playing her with a secondary Hydro can
      alleviate this issue. 


      __**Xingqiu**__: Like Yelan, he has strong single target damage but high
      ER needs. He provides defensive utilities such as minor healing and
      interruption resistance. 


      __**Xiangling**__: Even while Wanderer is in midair, Xiangling’s Pyronado
      can still hit enemies on the ground. She has strong AoE Pyro damage at the
      cost of high ER requirements. Recommended to play only with Bennett and
      potentially Favonius weapons. 


      __**Fischl**__: Has strong off-field single target damage while being
      relatively low maintenance. Wanderer is not a bad driver for her and can
      trigger multiple instances of her A4 and C6, further increasing damage. 


      __**Beidou**__: Specializes in AoE off-field damage. She offers
      interruption resistance via her burst as well as a small shield at C2,
      which Wanderer appreciates. However, she is greedy for energy and wants to
      be paired with Fischl to battery her. 


      __**Yae Miko**__: Yae’s damage is split between her Elemental Skill and
      Elemental Burst. She does not need her burst to deal damage, but it is a
      significant portion of her DPS. Contratrily, her burst costs 90 energy,
      making it difficult to burst every rotation, and even if you can, it leads
      to rotation extension.  


      __**Ganyu**__: Her burst can deal a fair amount of damage. With Faruzan’s
      grouping, she can take advantage of her burst’s targeting mechanics to
      deal even higher damage in AoE situations.


      __**Rosaria**__: Has solid damage output, especially with constellations.
      Also provides a partywide CRIT Rate buff with her passive.  


      __**Kaeya**__: Kaeya’s burst follows Wanderer while he is midair, making
      it impossible to hit most enemies. Not recommended.


      __**Ayaka**__: Most of Ayaka’s damage comes from her burst which is
      entirely off-field, allowing Wanderer to take the field. Not only does she
      have high multipliers, but also high energy cost! It is not recommended to
      play solo Cryo with Ayaka, and even if paired with another Cryo unit, she
      will struggle with energy. It can also be challenging to play her without
      Freeze, even with Faruzan’s grouping.
       
      __**Venti & Kazuha**__: Many people play Venti and Kazuha as supports, and
      in doing so also forget that they have high talent multipliers. Because
      Wanderer wants to run Faruzan and Bennett, this means Venti or Kazuha will
      also benefit from their buffs, producing noticeable damage. In teams with
      Wanderer, they will function closer to a subdps than a support.

  - title: '**Defensive Options**'
    description: >-
      Wanderer prefers having a shielder support over a healer, if possible.
      This is because Wanderer has low interruption resistance even during his
      Windfavored state. He can get staggered midair, which is a DPS loss, but
      dodging without his A4 ready also depletes his secondary stamina bar and
      reduces his DPS uptime.  


      __**Layla**__: Has a strong shield and allows Wanderer to gain 20% CRIT
      Rate through his A1. She is also a reliable Tenacity of the Millelith
      holder, and can buff Wanderer’s Normal and Charged Attacks at C4.


      __**Diona**__: Similar to Layla, but has a weaker shield and cannot hold
      Tenacity of the Millelith. On the contrary, she can heal.   


      __**Zhongli**__: His shield is the strongest in the game while also
      providing a 20% universal resistance shred as well as 20% ATK from
      Tenacity of the Millelith. While not the best option, he is a good comfort
      pick with some buffs and debuffs in his kit. 


      __**Thoma**__: Unlike the above shielders, Thoma relies on his burst to
      maintain uptime on his shield, which to some players may be a turnoff.
      Though his ER needs are demanding, his shield is reliable. He can provide
      a 30% ATK buff through Wanderer’s A1 passive and potentially complete Pyro
      resonance for 25% ATK. His C6 also confers 15% DMG to Normal and Charged
      attacks. 


      __**Jean**__: A decent healing option. With Faruzan’s buffs and lowered ER
      requirements, she can build into damage, although note she is not
      particularly impressive at C0. If Bennett is on the team, her damage can
      become significant via his ATK buff and her Sunfire tech. At C2, she
      provides a 15% ATK Speed buff, and shreds Anemo resistance by 40% at C4,
      boosting Wanderer’s damage by a significant margin. 


      __**Kokomi**__: Heals while holding Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and
      Tenacity of the Millelith for a total of a 68% ATK buff, and also gives
      Hydro absorption for Wanderer’s A1.

  - title: __**Do I need a battery for Wanderer?**__
    description: >-
      No. Most of Wanderer’s damage output comes from his Normal Attacks. While
      his burst deals a good amount of damage and should be used if possible, it
      is not the main feature of his kit.
