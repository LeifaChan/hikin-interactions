  - title: '*What about Wanderer teams without Faruzan?*'
    description: >-
      Not playing Wanderer with Faruzan will of course cause his DPS to drop. As
      mentioned, Anemo buffs/debuffs are rare, so there aren’t any suitable
      replacements for Faruzan. The nature of Wanderer’s teams will be warped,
      focusing on his *team’s* total output rather than just his personal
      damage. For example:


      1.) Playing Wanderer as a Driver. This can happen for both ADC and EM
      Builds. ADC Builds are favorable for Single Target scenarios or if a
      Buffer like Bennett is still present on the Team. Whereas an EM build
      primarily pays off in AoE scenarios with increased Reaction counts as he
      cant trigger enough Reactions against single targets for EM to be
      worthwhile. A Driver Playstyle also allows him to operate in a more quick
      swap-y fashion by cutting his Skill short and use it more frequently in
      shorter bursts across a rotation to allow teammates to cast their
      abilities off cooldown or even use his grounded form to fill gaps. This
      isn’t his optimal use case but can be a serviceable transitional or budget
      option for those who can’t field a Team centered around him or simply
      don't want to do so.


      2.) Pairing him with another strong team core (e.g Wanderer National)


      Alternatively, if you still want to build around Wanderer’s personal
      damage, you can form a three member core with Wanderer/Bennett/Yun Jin and
      add in an off-field DPS or utility support in the fourth slot.

  - title: '**EM Driver Wanderer**'
    description: >-
      A common trend among Anemo units is their synergy with EM and their
      ability to deal considerable amounts of damage with it. While Wanderer is
      capable of following in his predecessors’ footsteps, it is not optimal.
      His kit points to him being a selfish ATK-based DPS who deals most of the
      team’s damage without relying on reactions, the exact opposite of an EM
      driver.  He does get the benefit of being an Anemo catalyst and being able
      to hold VV, but this is not exclusive to him. Sucrose and Heizou fulfill
      both conditions and offer additional utility such as grouping and EM
      share. Nonetheless, he can still perform the role of an EM driver just
      fine.

      **Wanderer/Bennett/Xiangling/Xingqiu**


      Dubbed as “National” by the community,  Bennett/Xiangling/Xingqiu is a
      powerful three man core with high internal synergy. They deal substantial
      DPS by themselves, so practically any fourth member can be slotted in.
      Wanderer can hold VV to debuff enemies while also taking advantage of
      Bennett’s ATK buff. Compared to the Sucrose variation, his personal damage
      will be higher, but he has significantly less utilities such as EM share
      and grouping. Wanderers regular field time demands also make funneling
      Xiangling more troublesome. Usable, but nothing special even among
      National variants.
