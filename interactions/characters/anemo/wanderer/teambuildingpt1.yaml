  - title: __**TEAMBUILDING**__
    description: >-
      Wanderer is an ATK and CRIT based Anemo DPS, and is therefore not reliant
      on reactions to deal most of his damage, unless you intend to use an
      EM-based build. While he’ll likely trigger swirls and possibly chain
      reactions in his teams, they’re not pivotal to his damage. That being
      said, his A1 incentivizes players to bring Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro units
      to the team to obtain additional buffs. Each A1 buff is close to each
      other in strength, except for Electro which is volatile in value.
      Otherwise, Wanderer does not strongly prefer a specific element and is
      quite flexible with his team compositions. His teammates will either be a
      buffer, an off-field DPS, or a defensive option.
    color: null
  - title: '**Buffers**'
    description: >-
      More often than not, Wanderer will be dealing the majority of his team’s
      damage. It is never a bad idea to buff his personal damage, especially if
      your Wanderer is highly invested. 


      __**Faruzan**__: Faruzan is a new 4 star Anemo unit launching with
      Wanderer in 3.3, commonly dubbed as Wanderer’s dedicated support. Her kit
      revolves around buffing Anemo damage: she provides Anemo DMG% bonus,
      shreds Anemo resistance, CRIT DMG% at C6, and can group enemies. Anemo
      buffs and debuffs are extremely rare in the game, making Faruzan all the
      more valuable.  Needless to say, Faruzan is an integral part of Wanderer’s
      teams where his personal damage is the focal point. Additionally, if
      played with other off-field damage dealers, she can hold the 4 Viridescent
      Venerer (VV) set to debuff enemy and boost damage.  


      __**Bennett**__: Gives a massive ATK buff second to none, on top of 20%
      ATK from Noblesse Oblige, 30% through Wanderer’s A1, and another 25% if
      played with Pyro resonance. Also doubles as a defensive option by healing
      the team. Unquestionably a powerful support for not only Wanderer, but
      possibly his teammates if they benefit from his ATK buff.  


      __**Yun Jin**__: As Wanderer’s damage mostly comes from his Normal
      Attacks, Yun Jin is naturally one of the first picks that come to mind.
      Her burst grants a flat DMG buff to all Normal Attacks for up to 30
      stacks. At C2 and C6 respectively, she additionally provides 15% DMG to
      Normal Attacks and 12% ATK Speed. Wanderer’s N3 is multi-hit and his kit
      lends itself towards ATK speed, meaning Yun Jin’s stacks will be consumed
      faster–in other words, Wanderer gets even more mileage off Yun Jin.
      Unfortunately, she is not as strong in AoE situations. 


      __**Mona**__: With Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and her Omen debuff,
      Mona grants a 48% ATK, around 50% DMG bonus, and Hydro absorption for
      Wanderer’s A1. Unfortunately, her Omen debuff has low uptime, so she will
      fall behind other buffers.
    color: null
  - title: '**Off-field DPS**'
    description: >-
      Another way to increase team DPS aside from buffing Wanderer’s personal
      damage is to include an off-field DPS. Ironically, Wanderer does not
      provide much for these DPS units except for driving. Rather, it is Faruzan
      who supports these units by carrying the Viridescent Venerer set,
      providing grouping, and potentially through Favonius triggers. 


      It should be noted that many units under this category rely on their burst
      to dish out damage and will likely have high ER needs. To offset this,
      players can run a second unit of the same element to reduce ER needs or
      trade offensive stats for more ER. In the former case, Wanderer cannot
      absorb a secondary element through his A1 and thus loses a buff. In the
      latter scenario, the off-field DPS will of course lose significant damage
      and their place in the team becomes harder to justify. Alternatively, if
      the team consists of Bennett, the loss in damage can be mitigated. 


      __**Yelan**__: Has strong single target damage potential and can also buff
      Wanderer through her A4 passive which increases DMG% over time. On the
      downside, her ER requirements are quite high if played as solo hydro,
      significantly reducing her damage. Playing her with a secondary Hydro can
      alleviate this issue. 


      __**Xingqiu**__: Like Yelan, he has strong single target damage but high
      ER needs. He provides defensive utilities such as minor healing and
      interruption resistance. 


      __**Xiangling**__: Even while Wanderer is in midair, Xiangling’s Pyronado
      can still hit enemies on the ground. She has strong AoE Pyro damage at the
      cost of high ER requirements. Recommended to play only with Bennett and
      potentially Favonius weapons. 


      __**Fischl**__: Has strong off-field single target damage while being
      relatively low maintenance. Wanderer is not a bad driver for her and can
      trigger multiple instances of her A4 and C6, further increasing damage. 


      __**Beidou**__: Specializes in AoE off-field damage. She offers
      interruption resistance via her burst as well as a small shield at C2,
      which Wanderer appreciates. However, she is greedy for energy and wants to
      be paired with Fischl to battery her. 


      __**Yae Miko**__: Yae’s damage is split between her Elemental Skill and
      Elemental Burst. She does not need her burst to deal damage, but it is a
      significant portion of her DPS. Contratrily, her burst costs 90 energy,
      making it difficult to burst every rotation, and even if you can, it leads
      to rotation extension.  


      __**Ganyu**__: Her burst can deal a fair amount of damage. With Faruzan’s
      grouping, she can take advantage of her burst’s targeting mechanics to
      deal even higher damage in AoE situations.


      __**Rosaria**__: Has solid damage output, especially with constellations.
      Also provides a partywide CRIT Rate buff with her passive.  


      __**Kaeya**__: Kaeya’s burst follows Wanderer while he is midair, making
      it impossible to hit most enemies. Not recommended.


      __**Ayaka**__: Most of Ayaka’s damage comes from her burst which is
      entirely off-field, allowing Wanderer to take the field. Not only does she
      have high multipliers, but also high energy cost! It is not recommended to
      play solo Cryo with Ayaka, and even if paired with another Cryo unit, she
      will struggle with energy. It can also be challenging to play her without
      Freeze, even with Faruzan’s grouping.
       
      __**Venti & Kazuha**__: Many people play Venti and Kazuha as supports, and
      in doing so also forget that they have high talent multipliers. Because
      Wanderer wants to run Faruzan and Bennett, this means Venti or Kazuha will
      also benefit from their buffs, producing noticeable damage. In teams with
      Wanderer, they will function closer to a subdps than a support.

  - title: '**Defensive Options**'
    description: >-
      Wanderer prefers having a shielder support over a healer, if possible.
      This is because Wanderer has low interruption resistance even during his
      Windfavored state. He can get staggered midair, which is a DPS loss, but
      dodging without his A4 ready also depletes his secondary stamina bar and
      reduces his DPS uptime.  


      __**Layla**__: Has a strong shield and allows Wanderer to gain 20% CRIT
      Rate through his A1. She is also a reliable Tenacity of the Millelith
      holder, and can buff Wanderer’s Normal and Charged Attacks at C4.


      __**Diona**__: Similar to Layla, but has a weaker shield and cannot hold
      Tenacity of the Millelith. On the contrary, she can heal.   


      __**Zhongli**__: His shield is the strongest in the game while also
      providing a 20% universal resistance shred as well as 20% ATK from
      Tenacity of the Millelith. While not the best option, he is a good comfort
      pick with some buffs and debuffs in his kit. 


      __**Thoma**__: Unlike the above shielders, Thoma relies on his burst to
      maintain uptime on his shield, which to some players may be a turnoff.
      Though his ER needs are demanding, his shield is reliable. He can provide
      a 30% ATK buff through Wanderer’s A1 passive and potentially complete Pyro
      resonance for 25% ATK. His C6 also confers 15% DMG to Normal and Charged
      attacks. 


      __**Jean**__: A decent healing option. With Faruzan’s buffs and lowered ER
      requirements, she can build into damage, although note she is not
      particularly impressive at C0. If Bennett is on the team, her damage can
      become significant via his ATK buff and her Sunfire tech. At C2, she
      provides a 15% ATK Speed buff, and shreds Anemo resistance by 40% at C4,
      boosting Wanderer’s damage by a significant margin. 


      __**Kokomi**__: Heals while holding Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and
      Tenacity of the Millelith for a total of a 68% ATK buff, and also gives
      Hydro absorption for Wanderer’s A1.

  - title: __**Do I need a battery for Wanderer?**__
    description: >-
      No. Most of Wanderer’s damage output comes from his Normal Attacks. While
      his burst deals a good amount of damage and should be used if possible, it
      is not the main feature of his kit.

  - title: '**Hyper Wanderer**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Faruzan//Bennett/Flex**


      To no one’s surprise, pairing Wanderer with his best buffers skyrockets
      his personal damage, becoming the default hypercarry core for him. This
      configuration is particularly effective because the buffs each unit offers
      is unique and undiluted. Faruzan provides DMG% bonus, Anemo shred, and a
      CRIT DMG buff at C6, while Bennett supplies Wanderer with a ridiculous ATK
      buff. 


      Many characters can fit within the fourth team slot. Yun Jin’s Burst, for
      example grants additional flat damage to all Normal Attacks, *and* it
      scales with Faruzan’s buffs and debuffs. At C6, she will also give 12% ATK
      speed, another stat Wanderer greatly appreciates. Overall a potent team
      that scales well the more invested Wanderer is.

  - title: '**Double Hydro**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Yelan/Xingqiu**


      Pairs a strong Anemo duo with another Hydro duo. Yelan and Xingqiu are
      both off-field damage dealers who become even more powerful when slotted
      together, as they mitigate each other’s weaknesses. Provided they have an
      on-field DPS who can drive them, they can practically be put in any team.
      Wanderer enjoys Yelan’s ramping DMG% buff and Xingqiu’s defensive
      utilities on top of their high single target damage. Faruzan carries a VV
      set to lower Hydro resistance, and can use Favonius Warbow to reduce
      energy requirements.

      A double Cryo core grants Wanderer 20% CRIT Rate through his A1 passive as
      well as another 15% via Cryo resonance. He can run two offensive Cryo
      units such as Ganyu, Rosaria, and Ayaka, but can also run an offensive
      option plus a defensive option.

      **Wanderer/Faruzan/Anemo/Bennett or flex

      Anemo: Venti, Kazuha, Jean**


      Wanderer is not the only character who can benefit from Faruzan’s and
      Bennett’s buffs. Adding a third Anemo unit who can take advantage of their
      buffs is certainly a viable option. Unfortunately, many Anemo supports
      don’t provide utilities relevant to Wanderer, so they only function as a
      subdps. For example, Venti’s grouping is redundant since Faruzan already
      has some, and Kazuha’s A4 DMG bonus is straight-up useless for Wanderer.

      **Wanderer/Faruzan/Jean/Bennett**


      A variant of triple Anemo that uses Jean as the third Anemo unit combined
      with Bennett to trigger her Sunfire tech and deal more off-field damage.
      Jean has lower ER requirements than she normally would, while also
      benefiting from Faruzan and Bennett’s buffing. Aside from that, this team
      does not particularly stand out until Jean gains constellations, most
      noticeably at C2 and C4.

      This team composition leans towards comfort and consistency in exchange
      for lower damage potential. Wanderer loses two potential A1 buffs,
      although it is slightly offset with Geo resonance. Nonetheless, he will
      still have decent baseline damage due to Faruzan and Yun Jin supporting
      him along with minor buffs from Zhongli.

  - title: '**Double Pyro**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Bennett/Xiangling**


      One way to gain extra value from Bennett is using him to buff multiple
      units. Xiangling deals significant off-field AoE damage, can snapshot
      buffs, benefits from Faruzan’s VV debuff, and completes Pyro resonance for
      an extra 25% ATK. On the contrary, she has monstrous ER needs even with
      Bennett to battery her. If you cannot manage the team’s energy economy,
      her damage will plummet. 
       
      Thoma can also be traded in for Xiangling. While his damage is not as
      impressive, he brings a shield for Wanderer.

      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Fischl/Electro

      Electro options: Yae, Beidou, Kuki**


      Fischl, Yae, and Beidou are off-field Electro characters who are capable
      of dishing out serious damage. With Electro resonance, Fischl, and
      Wanderer’s A1 passive, the team is quite energy rich. Normally, Wanderer
      requires an unreasonable amount of ER to burst every rotation, but playing
      him on double Electro significantly reduces that threshold. It becomes
      feasible to burst every rotation with him, although you’ll still need to
      build a bit of ER on him. 


      Kuki can be played as a defensive option, but team output will
      significantly tank.

  - title: '*What about Wanderer teams without Faruzan?*'
    description: >-
      Not playing Wanderer with Faruzan will of course cause his DPS to drop. As
      mentioned, Anemo buffs/debuffs are rare, so there aren’t any suitable
      replacements for Faruzan. The nature of Wanderer’s teams will be warped,
      focusing on his *team’s* total output rather than just his personal
      damage. For example:


      1.) Playing Wanderer as a Driver. This can happen for both ADC and EM
      Builds. ADC Builds are favorable for Single Target scenarios or if a
      Buffer like Bennett is still present on the Team. Whereas an EM build
      primarily pays off in AoE scenarios with increased Reaction counts as he
      cant trigger enough Reactions against single targets for EM to be
      worthwhile. A Driver Playstyle also allows him to operate in a more quick
      swap-y fashion by cutting his Skill short and use it more frequently in
      shorter bursts across a rotation to allow teammates to cast their
      abilities off cooldown or even use his grounded form to fill gaps. This
      isn’t his optimal use case but can be a serviceable transitional or budget
      option for those who can’t field a Team centered around him or simply
      don't want to do so.


      2.) Pairing him with another strong team core (e.g Wanderer National)


      Alternatively, if you still want to build around Wanderer’s personal
      damage, you can form a three member core with Wanderer/Bennett/Yun Jin and
      add in an off-field DPS or utility support in the fourth slot.
    color: null
  - title: '**EM Driver Wanderer**'
    description: >-
      A common trend among Anemo units is their synergy with EM and their
      ability to deal considerable amounts of damage with it. While Wanderer is
      capable of following in his predecessors’ footsteps, it is not optimal.
      His kit points to him being a selfish ATK-based DPS who deals most of the
      team’s damage without relying on reactions, the exact opposite of an EM
      driver.  He does get the benefit of being an Anemo catalyst and being able
      to hold VV, but this is not exclusive to him. Sucrose and Heizou fulfill
      both conditions and offer additional utility such as grouping and EM
      share. Nonetheless, he can still perform the role of an EM driver just
      fine.
    color: null
  - title: '**Wanderer National**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Bennett/Xiangling/Xingqiu**


      Dubbed as “National” by the community,  Bennett/Xiangling/Xingqiu is a
      powerful three man core with high internal synergy. They deal substantial
      DPS by themselves, so practically any fourth member can be slotted in.
      Wanderer can hold VV to debuff enemies while also taking advantage of
      Bennett’s ATK buff. Compared to the Sucrose variation, his personal damage
      will be higher, but he has significantly less utilities such as EM share
      and grouping. Wanderers regular field time demands also make funneling
      Xiangling more troublesome. Usable, but nothing special even among
      National variants.
