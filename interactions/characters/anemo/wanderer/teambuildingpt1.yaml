      Wanderer is an ATK and CRIT based Anemo DPS, and is therefore not reliant
      on reactions to deal most of his damage, unless you intend to use an
      EM-based build. While he’ll likely trigger swirls and possibly chain
      reactions in his teams, they’re not pivotal to his damage. That being
      said, his A1 incentivizes players to bring Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro units
      to the team to obtain additional buffs. Each A1 buff is close to each
      other in strength, except for Electro which is volatile in value.
      Otherwise, Wanderer does not strongly prefer a specific element and is
      quite flexible with his team compositions. His teammates will either be a
      buffer, an off-field DPS, or a defensive option.

    description: >-
      More often than not, Wanderer will be dealing the majority of his team’s
      damage. It is never a bad idea to buff his personal damage, especially if
      your Wanderer is highly invested. 


      __**Faruzan**__: Faruzan is a new 4 star Anemo unit launching with
      Wanderer in 3.3, commonly dubbed as Wanderer’s dedicated support. Her kit
      revolves around buffing Anemo damage: she provides Anemo DMG% bonus,
      shreds Anemo resistance, CRIT DMG% at C6, and can group enemies. Anemo
      buffs and debuffs are extremely rare in the game, making Faruzan all the
      more valuable.  Needless to say, Faruzan is an integral part of Wanderer’s
      teams where his personal damage is the focal point. Additionally, if
      played with other off-field damage dealers, she can hold the 4 Viridescent
      Venerer (VV) set to debuff enemy and boost damage.  


      __**Bennett**__: Gives a massive ATK buff second to none, on top of 20%
      ATK from Noblesse Oblige, 30% through Wanderer’s A1, and another 25% if
      played with Pyro resonance. Also doubles as a defensive option by healing
      the team. Unquestionably a powerful support for not only Wanderer, but
      possibly his teammates if they benefit from his ATK buff.  


      __**Yun Jin**__: As Wanderer’s damage mostly comes from his Normal
      Attacks, Yun Jin is naturally one of the first picks that come to mind.
      Her burst grants a flat DMG buff to all Normal Attacks for up to 30
      stacks. At C2 and C6 respectively, she additionally provides 15% DMG to
      Normal Attacks and 12% ATK Speed. Wanderer’s N3 is multi-hit and his kit
      lends itself towards ATK speed, meaning Yun Jin’s stacks will be consumed
      faster–in other words, Wanderer gets even more mileage off Yun Jin.
      Unfortunately, she is not as strong in AoE situations. 


      __**Mona**__: With Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and her Omen debuff,
      Mona grants a 48% ATK, around 50% DMG bonus, and Hydro absorption for
      Wanderer’s A1. Unfortunately, her Omen debuff has low uptime, so she will
      fall behind other buffers.
