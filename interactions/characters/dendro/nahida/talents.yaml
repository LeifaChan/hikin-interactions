      The majority of Nahida’s damage comes from her Elemental Skill, but her
      Elemental Burst buffs increase with talent levels so it’s important to
      level both. Nahida’s Normal Attacks don’t have impressive scaling and are
      mainly for applying Dendro so they aren’t as necessary. It’s  worth
      leveling if you’re playing her on-field.
