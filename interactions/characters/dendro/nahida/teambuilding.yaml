      *Nahida is a very versatile character, able to be played in almost every
      Dendro composition, on and off-field, with an EM sharing passive boot. Her
      Elemental Skill has high uptime, and her Dendro application is not
      constrained by energy. Rotations will change depending on what teammates
      you use just like artifact stats and weapons.*

      __Bloom Teams__

      **Nilou Bloom**
    description: >-
      Nahida / Nilou / Kokomi / Hydro 


      Hydro options: Xingqiu / Yelan / Barbara / Ayato


      Due to the way Nahida applies Dendro with her Elemental Skill, she
      unfortunately can’t be used as solo Dendro off-field for Nilou Bloom
      teams. However, her on-field application is strong enough that she can
      keep a Dendro aura on the enemy, allowing for your Hydro teammates to
      trigger a lot more Blooms. Although Nahida can still get some ownership on
      Blooms, building Elemental Mastery on your Hydro teammates is still
      recommended. If Kokomi or someone else on the team is built for full EM,
      Nahida’s A1 passive can end up using their EM rather than her own,
      allowing for a larger EM buff whilst on-field.

  - title: '**Hyperbloom**'
    description: >-
      Nahida / Hydro / Electro / Flex


      Hydro options: Xingqiu / Yelan / Kokomi / Ayato

      Electro options: Electro DPS / Kuki / Fischl / Yae

      Flex options: Anemo / Beidou / DMC / Collei / Any above teammate


      Nahida's Dendro application is capable of allowing an Electro unit to
      build EM to deal large amounts of DMG with Hyperbloom. This composition
      also allows for Quicken, Aggravate and Spread to be triggered
      (Quickbloom), further increasing overall team damage. Due to Nahida’s high
      amount of Dendro application, the last slot can be used to fill any
      necessary roles such as healing, shielding or buffing.

  - title: '**Burgeon**'
    description: >-
      Nahida / Hydro / Pyro / Flex


      Hydro options: Ayato / Kokomi / Xingqiu / Yelan

      Pyro options: Thoma / Xiangling / Xinyan 

      Flex options: Anemo / Bennett / Any above teammate


      Nahida's Dendro application allows for a Pyro unit to build full EM to
      maximize the DMG dealt by Burgeon. This team has one large caveat and
      that's its very delicate setup. If Burning is triggered, you may lose out
      on potential Burgeon procs due to having to overtake the Pyro application
      from Burning with your Hydro character.

      Flex options: Anemo / Dendro / Zhongli / Beidou / Any above teammate


      Quicken teams are very flexible, allowing Nahida to maximize Spread
      reactions by driving, or just provide enough off-field Dendro whilst an
      on-field Electro prioritizes their own Aggravates. Her A1 Passive is also
      helpful for providing more EM to your on-field character, further
      increasing the DMG output of your Spreads and Aggravates.

      __Burning Teams__

      **Burnmelt**
    description: >-
      Nahida / Cyro / Pyro / Flex


      Cyro options: Ganyu / Ayaka / Kaeya / Rosaria

      Pyro options: Bennett / Xiangling / Thoma

      Flex options: Anemo / Pyro / Diona / Zhongli / Shenhe / Layla 


      Burning has been seen as a largely underwhelming reaction since Dendro's
      official launch in 3.0, the reduction to its Pyro application has
      effectively reduced its viability significantly. With the release of
      Nahida, Burning can now be used to enable Melt teams. However, with the
      setup being rather delicate, characters such as Ayaka may not make much
      use of Burning compared to someone like Ganyu due to the reaction being
      more susceptible to being ruined by additional Cryo applications.

    description: >-
      Nahida / Pyro / Flex / Flex


      Pyro options: Xiangling / Bennett / Klee / Thoma 

      Flex options: Anemo / Zhongli / Any above teammate


      Outside of using Burning to enable a Cryo character to trigger Melt, there
      is also the option of running full Burning based teams as it allows the
      use of 4PC Lavawalker for 35% DMG to opponents affected by Pyro. One flaw
      with this team is that Nahida doesn't really provide much other than
      fueling Burning. Also, Burning ticks are unable to proc Tri-Karma
      Purification, meaning Nahida ultimately ends up being reliant on Swirls
      from an Anemo character to deal damage with her Skill.
