      Nahida’s combos will differ depending on if you’re playing her on or
      off-field.


      **On-field:** 

      Nahida’s main goal whilst on-field is to apply as much Dendro as possible
      through her Normal Attacks whilst also driving the rest of the team. Her
      Elemental Skill can also be used to add extra Dendro applications during
      her field time. Her Charged Attack can be canceled extremely early,
      allowing for even more Dendro, however, due to being a Catalyst user, this
      can cause you to run out of stamina very quickly. 


      **Off-field:** 

      E, Q is recommended over Q, E due to her E being cancellable slightly
      early and also allows funneling particles to Nahida if Tri-Karma
      Purification procs during her Burst animation.
