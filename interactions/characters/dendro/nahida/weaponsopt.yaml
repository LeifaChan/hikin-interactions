      Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds
    description: >-
      A 5* option, providing 33.1% CR and a stacking Elemental DMG buff whilst
      on-field. Unfortunately, these stacks disappear when swapping between
      characters, meaning it's generally a CR stat stick but they’re a nice
      bonus when playing comps that play Nahida on-field.

    description: >-
      Another 5* option with a high Base ATK and a 33.1% ATK substat, as well as
      providing 12% Elemental DMG bonus and an extra portion of DMG from the
      clouds it creates. This ATK% can be valuable in places where Nahida is
      on-field but doesn’t have ownership on reactions but can leave her
      struggling for other more important stats overall.

  - title: Mappa Mare
    description: >-
      A F2P craftable Catalyst, providing 110 EM as well as an Elemental DMG
      Bonus buff upon triggering Elemental Reactions. Can be a very good option
      specifically for on-field Spread teams where Nahida has a lot of reaction
      ownership. However, for other scenarios, Nahida can struggle to trigger
      its passive due to how her Elemental Skill applies Dendro as well as her
      own reaction ownership in Bloom reaction teams.

  - title: Fruit of Fulfillment
    description: >-
      Another craftable Catalyst, providing 45.9% ER and an EM buff at the cost
      of ATK. Generally, the passive isn’t enough stats to make this weapon
      worth crafting over other options and the large amount of stats from the
      substat aren’t as useful although it can mean you can focus on more
      offensive substats in artifacts.

  - title: Blackcliff Agate
    description: >-
      A 4* option which can be bought from the Starglitter store, providing
      55.1% CDMG as well as ATK% when defeating an enemy. Unfortunately, ATK%
      does very little for Nahida and she can struggle to gain stacks at all,
      especially off-field, due to the enemy needing to die to her damage.
      Basically just a CDMG stat stick if you don’t have other options.

  - title: Hakushin Ring
    description: >-
      A more supportive craftable Catalyst, providing 30.6% ER and an Elemental
      DMG Bonus to Dendro and Electro when Nahida triggers Quicken. This weapon
      sacrifices Nahida’s personal damage a bit in return for buffing the rest
      of the party, allowing more of the team’s damage to come from her
      teammates instead.

  - title: Prototype Amber
    description: >-
      Another more supportive craftable Catalyst, which sacrifices Nahida’s
      personal damage a lot in exchange for healing the party upon casting her
      Elemental Burst. If you need some role consolidation in a Dendro healer,
      it’s an option you can use although may not be enough to survive on for
      some players.

  - title: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers
    description: >-
      A 3* F2P Catalyst that utterly butchers Nahida’s personal damage in
      exchange for its 48% ATK buff. Generally not recommended, unless you
      intend for Nahida to be a pure support.
