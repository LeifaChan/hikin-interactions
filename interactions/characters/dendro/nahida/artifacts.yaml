      __Mainstats__


      **Sands** - EM > ATK%

      **Goblet** - Dendro% / EM 

      **Circlet** - Crit / EM


      EM mainstats are favoured if using a non-EM weapon and if Nahida is
      off-field. An ATK% sands is typically subpar to its EM counterpart,
      especially if you intend to maximize Nahida’s A1, but the gap can be
      closed if:

      1.) The ATK% sands has good substat quality

      2.) Nahida is being played on-field and performing Normal or Charged
      Attacks

      3.) Nahida does not trigger any reactions


      __Substats__


      ER (120-150% depending on team) > EM (~900-1000) >= CRIT > ATK%

      *In Bloom teams where Nahida can get some ownership of Blooms, EM becomes
      more valuable over CRIT and ATK stats.*


      Generally, it is recommended to reach **~900-1000 EM** on Nahida even if
      she is not triggering any reactions. This range is typically optimal for
      her damage output, whilst also maximizing her A1 passive. Going beyond
      1000 EM is not usually recommended, unless she is on a Bloom team where
      she has high ownership of Blooms. In that case, reaction damage becomes a
      huge portion of her damage and CRIT becomes less relevant. 


      **TLDR:** Triple EM is the easiest way to get near 1000 EM, but if you can
      pass that threshold, other mainstats start becoming better (except in
      Bloom teams where Nahida gets some ownership). 


      1. For Spread teams and teams where Nahida has little reaction ownership,
      aim for artifacts that get you closest to the 900-1000 EM range (factoring
      in external buffs) while also meeting your ER needs of **120% ER** for
      Spread and **140-150% ER** for teams such as Hyperbloom or Burgeon. After
      that, start prioritizing CRIT substats. ATK substats do increase Nahida’s
      damage output, but are low priority.


      a. On-field Nahida gets the benefit of her A1, so typically triple EM will
      cause her to go beyond 1000 EM. In this case, it is recommended to use a
      Dendro Goblet and/or CRIT Circlet. 


      b. For teams where Nahida is specifically on-field but has low reaction
      ownership, 1000 EM is less important to aim for and CRIT substats become
      more valuable. 


      2. For Bloom teams where Nahida gets a significant amount of Blooms: Run
      triple EM mainstats while also meeting your ER needs of **130% ER**. EM
      substats take precedence, even if you go beyond 1000 EM. CRIT substats are
      fine, but not as important.

      __**Recommended**__

      **4PC Deepwood Memories**
    description: >-
      Proccing on Elemental Skill hits, this set is practically made for Nahida,
      allowing for 30% Dendro RES shred 100% of the time, increasing not only
      her damage but also other Dendro party members and Bloom reactions. Fits
      her very well whether she’s on-field driving or off-field and will
      generally be preferred if she’s the only Dendro in a team.

  - title: '**4PC Gilded Dreams**'
    description: >-
      If another character is already holding Deepwood, Nahida can benefit more
      from running Gilded Dreams, providing ATK% and EM depending on the
      teammates in the party. Generally will be giving 14% ATK and 180 EM with
      double Dendro or 230 EM as the only Dendro although she needs to proc a
      reaction to gain the effect which, due to how her Elemental Skill applies
      Dendro, may be hard to do from off-field only. Thus, it is not recommended
      in scenarios where Nahida does not trigger reactions very often (for
      example, off-field Nahida in Bloom teams).

  - title: '**2PC WT / 2PC GD / 2PC DW**'
    description: >-
      A consistent source of stats which isn’t reliant on Nahida proccing
      reactions, allowing her to make more use of the sets whilst off-field.
      Either 160 EM or 80 EM + 15% Dendro DMG%, both work for unconditional
      sets.

  - title: '**4PC Tenacity of the Millelith**'
    description: >-
      An uncommon option that trades Nahida’s personal damage for a more
      supportive role, providing 20% ATK to the party. It can be quite powerful
      or even BiS if your damage dealers are disproportionately stronger than
      Nahida. With another party member running Deepwood, this can be a usable
      option in some situations or whilst farming for a dedicated set for
      Nahida.

  - title: '**4PC Noblesse Oblige**'
    description: >-
      It has the same 20% ATK buff as 4PC Tenacity of the Millelith, but with
      worse uptime. It may be situationally better if you want to buff multiple
      party members.
