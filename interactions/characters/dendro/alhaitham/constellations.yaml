    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    C1 - Intuition
  description: |-
    *When a Projection Attack hits an opponent, **Universality: An Elaboration on Form's** CD is decreased by 1.2s. This effect can be triggered once every 1s.*

    Practically useless. This Constellation allows Alhaitham to use his Elemental Skill again faster when attacking on-field. However, this has no significant effect on gameplay, because Alhaitham’s long cooldown on his Elemental Skill doesn’t allow him to use his Skill twice in most rotations even with this Constellation. Using a second Skill during Alhaitham’s field time also brings the massive drawback of generally having its cooldown not ready in time for the next rotation, as the cooldown on the second Skill will not be sufficiently reduced with his C1. The best use case for this Constellation may be enabling rotations shorter than 18s, using one Skill per rotation. But as of now, this Constellation only has value in overworld/co-op and is otherwise merely a stepping-stone to other Constellations.

- title: C2 - Debate
  description: |-
    *When Alhaitham generates a Chisel-Light Mirror, his Elemental Mastery will be increased by 50 for 8 seconds, max 4 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently. This effect can be triggered even when the maximum number of Chisel-Light Mirrors has been reached.*

    C2 can be regarded as Alhaitham’s overall second-best Constellation after his C6, providing players with a significant 200 EM boost at maximum stacks. However, if players possess Nahida, it is advised to get her C2 instead, which offers better value in increasing Alhaitham’s personal DPS than his own C2.

- title: C3 - Negation
  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of Universality: An Elaboration on Form by 3.*

    Given that most of Alhaitham’s damage comes from Spread, which is independent of Talent Levels, C3 provides only a modest ~5% boost. However, players should note that C3 still provides a greater damage boost than C5.

- title: C4 - Elucidation
  description: |-
    *When Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena is unleashed, the following effects will become active based on the number of Chisel-Light Mirrors consumed and created this time around:

    ·Each Mirror consumed will increase the Elemental Mastery of all other nearby party members by 30 for 15s.
    ·Each Mirror generated will grant Alhaitham a 10% Dendro DMG Bonus for 15s.

    The pre-existing duration of the aforementioned effects will be cleared if you use Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena again while they are in effect.*

    C4 allows Alhaitham to give his teammates an Elemental Mastery buff when he consumes Mirrors, and also gives Alhaitham a Dendro DMG Bonus when he generates them. Since Alhaitham typically starts his rotations with no Mirrors, he usually only benefits from the personal Dendro DMG Bonus. C4 becomes more valuable when C6 is activated, because the latter allows you to consume Mirrors for the team buff while always receiving max Dendro DMG Bonus on Alhaitham. Overall a decent Constellation, and better with C6.

- title: C5 - Sagacity
  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena by 3.*

    C5 provides a negligible damage increase in standard rotations where his Burst is used with zero Mirrors, though it has slightly more value in Burst nuke setups. As mentioned previously, most of Alhaitham’s damage comes from Spread, which is unaffected by Talent Levels. This Constellation is only worth getting if you are going for C6 anyway.

- title: C6 - Structuration
  description: "*Alhaitham gains the following effects:\n· 2 seconds after Particular
    Field: Fetters of Phenomena is unleashed, he will generate 3 Chisel-Light Mirrors
    regardless of the number of mirrors consumed.\n· If Alhaitham generates Chisel-Light
    Mirrors when their numbers have already maxed out, his CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG
    will increase by 10% and 70% respectively for 6s. \n\nIf this effect is triggered
    again during its initial duration, the duration remaining will be increased by
    6s.*\n\nLike many characters, Alhaitham’s best Constellation is C6. It ensures
    that his Burst always grants the maximum number of Mirrors, along with a potential
    CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG buff. However, it comes with its own caveats—if you try
    to get some stacks on Burst to take advantage of the guaranteed 3-Mirror refund,
    you need to save either Skill or A1 to activate the C6 buff by overcapping with
    the Burst-generated Mirrors. This limits the damage potential of his field time
    before Burst and also shortens the maximum 3-Mirror uptime he can get after Burst.
    Players willing to unlock his sixth Constellation are still advised to open with
    the QE rotation, which should provide a 12s C6 buff from the start as the second
    Mirror overcap also triggers the duration extension."
