  description: "Alhaitham generally wants to maintain 3-Mirror uptime while he is
    on field, as 3-Mirror Projection Attacks yield the greatest damage and Dendro
    application. \n\nMore testing is needed to determine specific optimal combos for
    Alhaitham. Combo optimization aims to: (a) maintain Mirror uptime, (b) line up
    basic attack hitmarks to lower the interval at which Projection Attacks get triggered,
    (c) maximize the rate of Dendro application from his basic attacks and (d) much
    less importantly, maximize MV/s.\n\nBelow are some general principles for playing
    Alhaitham."

  description: |-
    To maximize the length of 3-Mirror uptime, open with Burst, attack/wait/swap for 2s until you get the Mirrors from Burst, then use NAs for ~4s. Use either CA or E to refresh 3 Mirrors, attack for ~4s more, then use E or CA (whichever one you didn't already use) to refresh 3 Mirrors again. You should avoid using CAs in your attack string until you actually want to trigger A1 to top up your Mirrors. After you trigger A1, you can opt to mix CAs into your attack string.

    If you want less than 12s total field time, it is optimal to use Q and then E immediately, since this allows you to get the Conversion and start triggering Projection Attacks slightly earlier than waiting 2s for the Mirrors from Burst.

    If you opt to Burst every other rotation, you should open the Burstless rotation with E N1C/N2C to get 3 Mirrors and then attack for your desired amount of fieldtime as the Mirrors fall off one by one.

- title: Optimal Attack Strings
  description: |-
    N3 dash cancel (N3D) is the optimal NA-only attack string to maximize Dendro application, since his third NA is a multihit. However, be careful not to cancel it too early and accidentally miss the second hit of the third NA.

    N2C and N3C are viable CA-based attack strings to maximize the rate of Dendro application. N2C is about the same duration as N3D and is easier to pull off since it doesn't require dash canceling, but its hitmarks may not line up well to maximize Projection Attacks. More live testing is needed to optimize attack strings to maximize Projection Attack procs.

    N1C is the fastest way to trigger A1. If you use it when you have no Mirrors, the CA will both trigger A1 and proc the first Projection Attack.

    If driving Xingqiu/Yelan/C6 Fischl, it’s better to use strings without CAs.

- title: Other Mechanics
  description: |-
    You can use Burst, swap to use a quick ability on another character (such as Dendro Traveler E to funnel particles to Alhaitham, Kuki E, Fischl E, etc), and swap back within 2s to catch the Mirrors generated from Burst. However, if you can’t swap back in time because you get interrupted or delayed, you will lose the Mirrors from Burst, **so use this at your own risk**. Note that this technique may not be viable at high ping.

    Tap E is generally better than Hold E since it’s faster.

    A Plunge Attack can trigger both A1 and Projection Attack from the same hit, prioritizing Mirror creation first and then triggering the Projection Attack. This means that you can use Hold E and Plunge to get 3 Mirrors and immediately trigger a 3-stack Projection Attack.

- title: Burst Quickswap
  description: As his Burst multipliers are somewhat underwhelming and he has long
    18s CDs on Skill and Burst, using him as a quickswap unit is generally not recommended.
    However, if you do choose to use him this way, you can do E N1C/N2C to quickly
    gain 3 Mirrors and then Burst with 3 stacks. Note that pre-C6, this means you
    won’t have any Mirrors available after Burst, and will need to swap to other units.

- title: C6 Combos
  description: The guaranteed 3-Mirror generation from Burst at C6 allows for more
    flexibility in using Burst with some stacks part-way through his field time and
    additional Mirror uptime after Burst. However, the C6 CRIT buff will not proc
    if you do not save an E or CA for after Burst to overcap the Mirrors. As such,
    it is possible that even at C6, his optimal combo remains opening his rotation
    with QE. QE also gives you 12s of C6 buff uptime from the get go, as the C6 duration
    extension is triggered by immediately overcapping by 2 Mirrors.
