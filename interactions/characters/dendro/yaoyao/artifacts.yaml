    __Notable Sets__

    *4pc Deepwood Memories [Non-Bloom][Bloom]*
  description: Yaoyao’s BiS artifact for all of her damage applications with a caveat.
    While she has excellent uptime for the set, the small AoE from Radish explosions
    means that coverage in a heavy multi-target situation will suffer. In Nilou Bloom
    teams, it is highly recommended for another Dendro unit to equip this set and
    free Yaoyao to equip a more healing-centric set instead due to the above-mentioned
    reason and the very high demand for survivability.

- title: "*4pc Maiden Beloved [Non-Bloom][Bloom]*"
  description: Yaoyao’s BiS artifact for her healing applications. The set’s effect
    uptime perfectly covers the entirety of her Elemental Skill’s duration, and it
    could be refreshed to boost the team-wide healing from her burst. If the player
    is looking to farm this set, getting the correct main stat will be good enough
    and grinding substats here is not recommended.

- title: "*4pc Tenacity of the Millelith [Non-Bloom]*"
  description: An excellent support set in non-Bloom teams. She has great uptime on
    this set and the HP from this set’s 2pc effect helps with healing. In non-Bloom
    teams, the ATK will be appreciated by the entire team. It is worth noting that
    Yaoyao’s Burst will transform all Radish DMG into Burst DMG, meaning the set’s
    4pc effect will not be active during that time.

- title: "*4pc Instructors [Non-Bloom][Bloom]*"
  description: A very good option for boosting the entire team’s damage. Non-Bloom
    teams and especially Bloom teams will enjoy the EM boost. The frequency Yaoyao
    applies Dendro also ensures that the set has good uptime. As Instructor is a 4-star
    artifact set, the lower base stats will result in less healing, though it’s not
    far off on a full healer build.

    __Honerable Mentions__

    *2pc HP/HB/EM/Dendro DMG Bonus mix and match*
  description: To achieve the most amount of healing, Healing Bonus is preferred over
    HP and to achieve the most amount of damage, Dendro DMG Bonus is preferred over
    EM. Generally 2+2pc are solid performers on Yaoyao and not far off from her BiS
    artifacts in each build scenario.

- title: "*4pc Gilded Dreams [Non-Bloom]*"
  description: A good set for Yaoyao’s personal damage. However, she is not going
    to be the main damage dealer from the team, therefore the opportunity cost here
    is quite high. Slotting in sets with support capabilities is preferred.

- title: "*4pc Exile [Bloom]*"
  description: A set catered to easing the team’s ER requirement, which can be especially
    handy in ER-hungry teams like Nilou Bloom. However, it does require Yaoyao to
    Burst consistently, which might be undesirable in teams with less ER requirement
    and pressure for survival.
