    value: "*Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until
      release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
      Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little
      information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally,
      are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ
      should be taken with a grain of salt.*"

- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Yaoyao is a Dendro Polearm character and the first Dendro healer in
    the game. Aside from being a solid healer, being a Dendro character opens her
    up to some unique applications. Her role in a team composition is flexible thanks
    to her low desire for on-field time and in many applications low desire for Energy
    as well. \n\nYaoyao’s playstyle can be split into two directions: Elemental Skill
    focused or Elemental Skill & Elemental Burst focused. The main differentiator
    between these playstyles is the requirement for ER and on-field time. Yaoyao’s
    healing scales off of her HP. Because of her HP% Ascension stat and high Base
    HP, she gets more value out of Healing Bonus% than HP%. As an off-field DPS, she
    wants a good balance between Dendro DMG Bonus, CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG and EM (to boost
    Spread DMG). Artifact set and Weapon wise, she is not picky, and players are free
    to choose whichever combo fits their team-building the best. \n\nWhile picking
    playstyles for Yaoyao, the main thing to consider is the pressure of survival.
    Her Burst can be treated as an emergency heal button for the whole team. Using
    it will extend her on-field time and decrease the overall team’s DPS by a small
    margin, in exchange for a substantial amount of healing. For instance, in teams
    with less i-frames and high self-damage like Nilou Bloom/Burgeon, players would
    likely utilize Yaoyao’s Burst more often than other typical Aggravate/Spread teams.
    \n\nYaoyao performs all of her core functions at C0. Her Constellations provide
    QoL features such as Stamina restoration, ER requirement reduction, self EM boost,
    extra Dendro application and healing."
