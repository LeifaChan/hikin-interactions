  description: "For HP scaling characters, it's usually recommended to level them
    to 90. If not, Yaoyao should at least be fully ascended to take advantage of the
    HP ascension stat. \n\nYaoyao’s Elemental Skill creates one instance of *Yuegui:
    Throwing Mode*, a turret-like summon akin to Fischl’s Oz. By holding the Skill
    button, players can also manually adjust the position of the summon on initial
    cast, similar to Amber’s Baron Bunny. *Yuegui: Throwing Mode* will continuously
    throw out projectiles called *White Jade Radishes*. Upon contact with either an
    enemy or a character, they will explode and deal damage to the enemy while healing
    the on-field character within the same AoE, albeit a relatively small one. If
    a Radish does not contact an enemy or a character, it will remain on the field
    for 5 seconds. \n\n“Yuegui: Throwing Mode” also has a set of logic for picking
    its target: \nIf the on-field character has below 70%: targets the on-field character\nIf
    the on-field character has above 70% HP with enemies present: targets the enemy\nIf
    the on-field character has above 70% HP without enemies present: targets the on-field
    character\n\nYaoyao’s Elemental Burst grants her the *Adeptal Legacy* state while
    **she is on-field**. This state’s effect consists of three parts:\nYaoyao will
    throw out three instances of *Yuegui: Jumping Mode*, turrets with the exact same
    targeting logic as *Yuegui: Throwing Mode*, in very quick succession. \nAll of
    the *White Jade Radishes* fired during this state, from both *Yuegui: Throwing
    Mode* and *Yuegui: Jumping Mode*, will be converted to *Adeptal Legacy White Jade
    Radishes*. They deal extra damage and healing, and they are considered as Elemental
    Burst DMG. The healing also benefits her whole team instead of only the on-field
    character like her Skill. \nYaoyao gains 15% Movement SPD and 50% Dendro RES Bonus.
    \nIf Yaoyao leaves the field, all Yuegui: Jumping Mode will immediately despawn.
    \n\nYaoyao’s 1st Ascension Passive is a nice addition to her Burst mechanic, as
    she is encouraged to move around while in her *Adeptal Legacy* state, evading
    a large portion of both damage from enemies or Bloom self-damage, at the same
    time boosting her healing even further. Her 4th Ascension Passive is another addition
    to her healing. It’s worth noting that this Passive will be hard to trigger when
    the Yueguis are targeting the enemy instead of Yaoyao herself due to the small
    Radish AoE.\n\nYaoyao’s Utility Passive is very handy for exploration, as it reduces
    difficulty for catching Crystalflies or wildlife for teapot."
