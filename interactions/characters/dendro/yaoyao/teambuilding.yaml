  description: "Early potential teams for Alhaitham primarily focus on **Spread**
    for his personal damage. Additionally, he may be used as a driver in **Bloom**,
    **Hyperbloom** and **Burgeon** comps. **Quickbloom** teams—teams that allow for
    both Hyperbloom and Quicken to coexist through slow Hydro application—have also
    shown great promise. These teams should have similar Quicken uptime to Spread
    teams, with additional Hyperbloom DMG. \n\nNote that in Burgeon, Nilou Bloom and
    Hyperbloom teams where Alhaitham does not get many Spreads, his personal damage
    will be underwhelming. It would thus be more useful for him to Burst every rotation
    for better Mirror uptime and higher Dendro application. To reach his ER requirements,
    particularly when he is the solo Dendro unit, it is likely better to gear him
    with supportive ER weapons like Favonius Sword."

  description: "Example Team: Alhaitham/Nahida/Fischl/Kuki Shinobu\nExample Team 2:
    Alhaitham/Yae Miko/Fischl/Zhongli \n\nWith his high Dendro application and EM
    to DMG% conversion on his A4, it’s no surprise that Spread is a massive boon to
    Alhaitham’s DPS output. Additionally, there are multiple Electro units that can
    contribute substantial off-field damage via Aggravate. A secondary Dendro unit
    can also be slotted in for extra Spread procs and Dendro Resonance. \n\n**Electro

- title: __Hyperbloom/Quickbloom Teams__
  description: "Example Team: Alhaitham/Kuki Shinobu/Xingqiu/Nahida\nExample Team
    2: Alhaitham/Raiden Shogun/Xingqiu/Yelan\n\nQuickbloom teams utilize a lower amount
    of Hydro application compared to Dendro application, so as to allow for high to
    full Quicken uptime with additional Hyperbloom DMG from Electro character(s).
    Quickbloom teams focus more on Alhaitham’s on-field Spread DMG and the Electro
    character’s Aggravate DMG, though units with EM-scaling such as Kuki can also
    build full EM to maximize Hyperbloom DMG. Alhaitham should stick with his normal
    EM/DMG/CRIT build. \n\nNote that due to Alhaitham’s high Dendro application and
    tendency to run with Nahida as a second Dendro, you should still get decent Quicken
    uptime even with a unit like Xingqiu.\n\nHyperbloom teams utilize more abundant
    Hydro application, resulting in notably lower Quicken uptime and a much greater
    portion of team damage coming from Hyperblooms. Alhaitham serves more of an on-field
    driver role in such teams. It may be beneficial to run two Hydro units to keep
    up with Alhaitham’s on-field Dendro application.\n\n**Electro Units:** Kuki Shinobu,
    Raiden Shogun, Yae Miko, Fischl, Lisa, Beidou\n**Hydro Units:** Xingqiu, Yelan,
    Kokomi, Barbara\n**Flex Units:** Zhongli, Kazuha, Sucrose, Dendro units"

- title: __Burgeon Teams__
  description: |-
    Example Team: Alhaitham/Thoma/Kokomi/Xingqiu

    With his high, consistent Dendro application, Alhaitham can be used as an on-field unit to enable Burgeon teams. However, such teams have delicate setups, as triggering Burning can easily lose Blooms. Running a defensive unit such as a healer/shielder is also necessary due to Burgeon self-damage.

    **Pyro Unit:** Thoma
    **Hydro Units:** Xingqiu, Yelan
    **Flex Units:** Zhongli, Fischl, Kokomi, Kazuha, Sucrose, Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, Yaoyao

- title: __Bloom Teams__
  description: "Example Team: Alhaitham/Nilou/Kokomi/Nahida\nExample Team 2: Alhaitham/Nilou/Kokomi/Xingqiu\n\nAlhaitham
    can also be used as an on-field Dendro enabler in Nilou teams.  Unfortunately,
    he has little utility, and his personal damage will be lower than usual as he
    has little reaction ownership unless all three of his teammates are Hydro units.
    It is strongly recommended to bring a healer, or Alhaitham will not survive the
    Bloom self-damage. Swapping him out midway is punishing, as his Elemental Skill
    has a 18s CD while his Burst costs 70 Energy, and he has no off-field Dendro application
    to compensate. \n\n**Hydro Units:** Nilou, Kokomi, Xingqiu, Yelan, Barbara\n**Dendro
    Units:** Nahida, Collei, Dendro MC, Yaoyao"
