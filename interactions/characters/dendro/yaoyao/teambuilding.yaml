    __TEAMBUILDING__

    *General Healer*
  description: |-
    Yaoyao’s unique disposition as a Dendro healer lets her play an important role in practically any Dendro-related teams or in teams where her Dendro application does not interfere with their intended reactions. Subsequently, as Yaoyao’s raw healing output is sufficient in most cases, her primary role will always be the healer of her teams—even when built offensively.

    Yaoyao’s Burst significance will shift as her teams’ healing needs change. There are a few factors that affect this:

    Team’s field-time distribution.
    Enemies’ team-wide DoT effects (e.g. Corrosion, Brand of the Abyssal Flame, etc.) or highly-damaging enemies like some bosses.
    Self-damaging effects from Dendro Cores (i.e. Nilou’s Bountiful Core, Hyperbloom, Burgeon).

    *Dendro Support*

    **Quicken Teams**
  description: |-
    Yaoyao as a solo-Dendro support in Aggravate teams provides rotation-tight Quicken aura uptime as well as her own damage through Spread, however insignificant it is. Her being the healer of said team will free up a slot for competitive Electro or Anemo picks—such as Yae, Kazuha, Sucrose, etc—which will naturally boost the Electro DPS slots’ performance.

    With that said, in Spread-centric teams, she has various utilities: Dendro Resonance, C1’s Dendro DMG% buff and some minor battery capabilities. More importantly, in the same vein as Aggravate teams, Yaoyao as the healer opens up her teams’ potential—giving leeway for Electro Resonance, supporting Energy-hungry characters (e.g. Alhaitham, Yae, Beidou, etc). Not just that, she also has indirect synergy with ranged teams like Tighnari’s or Nahida’s teams, as Kuki’s or Dori’s Electro application is largely limited by range/placement.

    *Character Options*
    **Dendro: Alhaitham, Collei, DMC, Nahida, Tighnari
    Electro: Beidou, Cyno, Fischl, Keqing, Lisa, Raiden, Sara, Yae
    Flex: (another Dendro/Electro unit) or Kazuha, Sucrose, Venti, Zhongli**

- title: "**Nilou Bloom**"
  description: |-
    Since Nilou’s Bountiful Cores explode immediately and can deal lethal damage in their damage window, Yaoyao is one of Nilou’s teams’ essential picks with her Skill’s Yuegui off-field heals, A4 healing effect and on-field team-wide healing from her Burst (the personal Dendro RES will also help her survive during this phase). As such, Yaoyao when played in a Nilou Bloom team should be built with enough ER to consistently Burst every rotation for the teamwide healing and to lessen others’ burden by taking on some Bloom DMG herself. Artifacts featuring HP and Healing Bonus from a healing-centric set like 4pc Maiden are generally recommended unless there isn’t already a better holder of 4DW, in which case Yaoyao will use it herself instead.

    With that said, since Yuegui’s priority switches to healing (as opposed to attacking) when the on-field character’s health goes under 70%, it is still recommended to use another Dendro character alongside Yaoyao, as her own Dendro application proves to be insufficient for creating enough Bountiful Cores to comfortably clear higher Abyss Chambers. In Nahida’s case, Yaoyao’s Dendro application triggers her Tri-Karma Purification and allows her to be used off-field so that another on-field Hydro DPS (Ayato or Tartaglia) can take the reins instead, reinforcing the team’s AoE potential. Furthermore, with Yaoyao as the main healer of the team, this lets Kokomi (with her high Bloom ownership) be built with full EM on 4OHC and become the team’s consistent source of Core generation. At the same time, having Kokomi in the team will help with team’s survivability against the high Bloom count, in which case Yaoyao’s own healing output won’t be enough without sacrificing team’s rotation time to Burst. Barbara using the same build instead of Kokomi will largely serve the same function but as a less effective substitute with her overall lower Bloom count and restrictive range.

    *Character Options*
    **Dendro: Alhaitham, Collei, DMC, Nahida
    Hydro: Ayato, Barbara, Candace, Kokomi, Tartaglia, Xingqiu, Yelan**

- title: "**Hyperbloom/Burgeon Teams**"
  description: |-
    Although not as a crucial slot, Yaoyao serves as a perfectly viable healer for Hyperbloom and Burgeon teams. Her main advantages (aside from healing) are Dendro Resonance and the ability to open up space for other characters, increasing options and flexibility when choosing teams. Something to note when fitting Yaoyao into these teams is that her Dendro application will likely not be enough for Burgeon teams, as Burning may interfere with Dendro Core generation. As such, slotting in another Dendro character with a strong Hydro applier will help solve this problem.

    *Character Options*
    **Hydro: Ayato, Candace, Kokomi, Tartaglia, Xingqiu, Yelan
    Electro/Pyro: Dori (C6), Fischl, Kuki, Raiden, Yae, Amber, Thoma, Yanfei
    (Fischl will need an Anemo trigger)
    Flex: Alhaitham, Collei, DMC, Nahida, Sucrose, Heizou**
