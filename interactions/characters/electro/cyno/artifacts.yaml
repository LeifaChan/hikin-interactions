      **4PC Thundering Fury**
    description: >-
      His optimal artifact set to run with a TF Combo. Giving him 15% Electro
      DMG, 40% Transformative DMG, 20% Aggravated DMG, and CD Reduction of 1s
      per Elemental Reaction proc that he can utilize when he is on Pactsworn
      Pathclearer. This set fits his playstyle well as a hypercarry that is able
      to bring out more damage over time with his required field-time.

  - title: '**4PC Gilded Dreams**'
    description: >-
      His optimal artifact set to run with a Non-TF Combo. Providing him ATK%
      and EM based on his team composition benefits his whole kit compared to
      Gladiator’s Finale. Solo Electro grants him 150 EM only, Double Electro
      grants him 14% ATK and 100 EM, and Mono-Electro with Dendro grants him 28%
      ATK and 50 EM. Realistically, this set buff uptime would be cut midway on
      his field-time and need to trigger another Elemental Reaction again to get
      said buffs.

  - title: '**4PC Gladiator’s Finale**'
    description: >-
      Able to provide 18% ATK and 35% Normal ATK DMG Bonus when the user is a
      Sword, Polearm, or Claymore wielder. This set is quite a good substitute
      for Gilded Dreams when it has better substats than the current pieces you
      have. Generally would run as Gilded Dream set is new to the game and
      getting the exact pieces on it are quite hard as of now unless one is
      lucky enough to already have it or resin refresh their way to getting it.

    description: >-
      Also contesting between Gladiator’s Finale and Gilded Dreams as their
      differences aren’t exactly that high. Granting Cyno 15% Electro DMG and 80
      EM without any requirements is easily an option for him to use these
      specific mixed sets.

      __***Questionable***__
      **4PC Thundersoother**
    description: >-
      This set provides 35% DMG Bonus when enemy is affected by Electro which
      sounds good on Cyno but in terms of its uptime, it will not be consistent
      due to Aggravate needing to remove the Electro aura to refresh Quicken
      again and leave no Electro aura for Cyno to proc the 4PC passive.
