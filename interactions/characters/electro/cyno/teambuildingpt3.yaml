  - title: '**Venti**'
    description: >-
      Has the most useful CC in the game and is able to lower down Cyno’s ER
      requirement depending on the team composition. It is still questionable if
      Cyno can hit enemies when his Elemental Burst is active on the field and
      that will need testing on live. Suffers the same result as every other
      Anemo unit in terms of carrying Viridescent Venerer.

  - title: '**Zhongli**'
    description: >-
      Has the strongest shield in the game and also provides a Physical and
      Elemental Shred that lasts for 20s depending on the shield’s HP. Generally
      is a must on Cyno as he is the only one who can provide him comfort and
      shred with his kit. However, his damage will be lacklustered if built
      specifically for the shield itself so carrying Favonius Lance and having
      CR% substats would be wise to run on him to help Cyno’s ER requirement.

  - title: '**Albedo**'
    description: >-
      Solid Geo off-field support unit that provides an EM buff with his A4.
      Paired with Zhongli to activate Geo Resonance that provides 15% Shield
      Strength to make Zhongli’s shield stronger, 15% DMG and 20% Geo RES Shred
      when the active character is shielded. With his Elemental Skill being proc
      on enemies taking DMG, Cyno can carry 4PC Archaic Petra to be able to proc
      the 35% Elemental DMG buff while on-field

    description: >-
      Paired with Zhongli to activate Geo Resonance that provides 15% Shield
      Strength to make Zhongli’s shield stronger, 15% DMG and 20% Geo RES Shred
      when the active character is shielded. She can buff Cyno’s Normal Attack
      with her Elemental Burst but it will be cut midway unto his rotation due
      to only having a 12s duration.

      __***Team Compositions***__

      **Aggravated Teams 
      (Cyno, Electro, Dendro, Anemo/Zhongli/Dendro)**
    description: >-
      With Cyno having a long field time, Aggravate can suffice for the lack of
      buffs he can use in terms of choosing units and Aggravate is easily
      accessible with only needing a Dendro unit to trigger the Quicken state to
      be be able to proc Aggravate with his NA and Elemental Skill. Note that he
      needs to have a Dendro unit that can match his fast Electro application
      and currently, only Dendro MC suffices for this role.

      **Hyperbloom Teams 
      (Cyno, Hydro, Dendro, Zhongli/Dendro/Electro)**
    description: >-
      Focuses on building Cyno on EM, which benefits his A4 passive and produces
      high amounts of damage with Hyperbloom procs. There are also chances that
      Cyno will trigger Aggravate in the team composition. Only caveat of this
      team composition is that it locks 3 spots on the team which means the last
      spot will have to flex out into options on whether you want RES Shed, EM
      buff, or batterying Cyno etc.

      **Electro-Charged Teams 
      (Cyno, Hydro, Anemo, Flex)**
    description: >-
      Theoretically a good team composition for him to run on due to him being
      Electro but as of now, the team composition is volatile with its certain
      mechanic in which it consumes Electro and Hydro aura while maintaining
      both aura on the enemy, which means ownership of this team composition
      will need live testing and counting.

      **Overvape 
      (Cyno, Xingqiu, Off-field Pyro, Flex)**
    description: >-
      Allowing the Pyro unit to trigger both Vape and Overload, this team
      composition stands out as Cyno’s overall damage is not lowered with him
      triggering Electro-Charged on-field while the Pyro off-field DPS like
      Xiangling or Thoma can trigger Vape and Overload off-field with their
      Elemental Burst. Xingqiu was locked in here as he provides fast Hydro
      application that can keep up with Cyno's field time.

      **Mono-Electro Teams 
      (Cyno, Electro, Electro, Anemo/Zhongli/Dendro)**
    description: >-
      A safe choice in his team composition as it is straightforward with his
      selection of units and helps Electro units who has high ER requirement to
      be much lower. However, 4PC Gilded Dream Set is lowered on numbers as Cyno
      loses out 50 EM for 28% ATK and is also locked into 3 Electro and 1 Dendro
      unit to be able to proc a reaction compared to 2 Electro which gives 100
      EM and 14% ATK.

      **Hyper Teams 
      (Cyno/Fischl/Zhongli/Geo)**
    description: >-
      Focusing on Cyno’s raw damage, this team composition is another
      straightforward one as the goal is to buff Cyno drastically. With Fischl
      on this team, Cyno would not have an issue with his ER Requirement and
      Zhongli provides comfort to his long field time.
