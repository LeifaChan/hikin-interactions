  - title: '**Hyper Wanderer**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Faruzan//Bennett/Flex**


      To no one’s surprise, pairing Wanderer with his best buffers skyrockets
      his personal damage, becoming the default hypercarry core for him. This
      configuration is particularly effective because the buffs each unit offers
      is unique and undiluted. Faruzan provides DMG% bonus, Anemo shred, and a
      CRIT DMG buff at C6, while Bennett supplies Wanderer with a ridiculous ATK
      buff. 


      Many characters can fit within the fourth team slot. Yun Jin’s Burst, for
      example grants additional flat damage to all Normal Attacks, *and* it
      scales with Faruzan’s buffs and debuffs. At C6, she will also give 12% ATK
      speed, another stat Wanderer greatly appreciates. Overall a potent team
      that scales well the more invested Wanderer is.

  - title: '**Double Hydro**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Yelan/Xingqiu**


      Pairs a strong Anemo duo with another Hydro duo. Yelan and Xingqiu are
      both off-field damage dealers who become even more powerful when slotted
      together, as they mitigate each other’s weaknesses. Provided they have an
      on-field DPS who can drive them, they can practically be put in any team.
      Wanderer enjoys Yelan’s ramping DMG% buff and Xingqiu’s defensive
      utilities on top of their high single target damage. Faruzan carries a VV
      set to lower Hydro resistance, and can use Favonius Warbow to reduce
      energy requirements.

  - title: '**Double Cryo**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Cryo/Cryo

      Cryo Units: Rosaria, Layla, Diona, Ayaka, Ganyu, Shenhe**
       
      A double Cryo core grants Wanderer 20% CRIT Rate through his A1 passive as
      well as another 15% via Cryo resonance. He can run two offensive Cryo
      units such as Ganyu, Rosaria, and Ayaka, but can also run an offensive
      option plus a defensive option.

  - title: '**Triple Anemo**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Faruzan/Anemo/Bennett or flex

      Anemo: Venti, Kazuha, Jean**


      Wanderer is not the only character who can benefit from Faruzan’s and
      Bennett’s buffs. Adding a third Anemo unit who can take advantage of their
      buffs is certainly a viable option. Unfortunately, many Anemo supports
      don’t provide utilities relevant to Wanderer, so they only function as a
      subdps. For example, Venti’s grouping is redundant since Faruzan already
      has some, and Kazuha’s A4 DMG bonus is straight-up useless for Wanderer.

  - title: '**Sunfire**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Faruzan/Jean/Bennett**


      A variant of triple Anemo that uses Jean as the third Anemo unit combined
      with Bennett to trigger her Sunfire tech and deal more off-field damage.
      Jean has lower ER requirements than she normally would, while also
      benefiting from Faruzan and Bennett’s buffing. Aside from that, this team
      does not particularly stand out until Jean gains constellations, most
      noticeably at C2 and C4.

  - title: '**Double Geo**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/Faruzan/Yun Jin/Zhongli**


      This team composition leans towards comfort and consistency in exchange
      for lower damage potential. Wanderer loses two potential A1 buffs,
      although it is slightly offset with Geo resonance. Nonetheless, he will
      still have decent baseline damage due to Faruzan and Yun Jin supporting
      him along with minor buffs from Zhongli.

  - title: '**Double Pyro**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Bennett/Xiangling**


      One way to gain extra value from Bennett is using him to buff multiple
      units. Xiangling deals significant off-field AoE damage, can snapshot
      buffs, benefits from Faruzan’s VV debuff, and completes Pyro resonance for
      an extra 25% ATK. On the contrary, she has monstrous ER needs even with
      Bennett to battery her. If you cannot manage the team’s energy economy,
      her damage will plummet. 
       
      Thoma can also be traded in for Xiangling. While his damage is not as
      impressive, he brings a shield for Wanderer.

  - title: '**Double Electro**'
    description: >-
      **Wanderer/VV Faruzan/Fischl/Electro

      Electro options: Yae, Beidou, Kuki**


      Fischl, Yae, and Beidou are off-field Electro characters who are capable
      of dishing out serious damage. With Electro resonance, Fischl, and
      Wanderer’s A1 passive, the team is quite energy rich. Normally, Wanderer
      requires an unreasonable amount of ER to burst every rotation, but playing
      him on double Electro significantly reduces that threshold. It becomes
      feasible to burst every rotation with him, although you’ll still need to
      build a bit of ER on him. 


      Kuki can be played as a defensive option, but team output will
      significantly tank.
