      **Staff of the Scarlet Sands**
    description: >-
      Cyno’s BiS weapon. Able to provide him 44.1% CR and flat ATK through his
      EM, which works really well with his kit focusing on EM primarily. At R1,
      it already provides a good amount of damage with Aggravate as the reaction
      is an additive reaction damage, which counts final ATK, DMG%, and CRIT to
      its formula.

      He utilizes this weapon very well as he focuses on Normal Attacks, which
      are fast to hit to trigger the weapons passive. Giving him 22.1% CR,
      stackable ATK%, and DMG% once stacks are maxed, this weapon is a great
      option to put on him as a 5* polearm

  - title: '**Staff of Homa**'
    description: >-
      A good stat stick on Cyno. Providing 66.2% CDMG, 20% HP and converting his
      final HP to flat ATK to increase his final ATK that affects all of his
      damage. The only caveat this weapon has is that Cyno cannot trigger its
      last passive which increases the conversion value of the final HP to flat
      ATK passive. Overall, slightly under White Tassel on Non-TF sets and under
      Primordial Jade Winged-Spear on TF set.

  - title: '**Deathmatch**'
    description: >-
      The battlepass weapon, which means one has to pay to get it. Able to give
      36.8% CR, and ATK% and DEF% respectively depending on how many enemies are
      near Cyno. If there is only 1 target, he gets a high amount of ATK%.
      However in 2 or more targets, he gets a slightly lower ATK% value but
      gains DEF% on that end. Nevertheless, this weapon is pretty much a good
      weapon to get due to its high CR% value for a 4* weapon but it is locked
      via the Battlepass.

      Surprisingly, a high contender amongst all the weapons that Cyno can use.
      Providing 23.4% CR and NA DMG% without any constraints makes this weapon
      value quite high. Being a 3* polearm, it is easily refinable to R5 due to
      it being obtainable through chests, and is an outstanding weapon to put on
      him as a F2P option.
