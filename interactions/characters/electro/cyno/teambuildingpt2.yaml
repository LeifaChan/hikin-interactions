      **Kokomi**
    description: >-
      Has consistent Hydro application with good healing that helps Cyno stay
      alive on the field longer. Preferably would run with Cyno on Hyperbloom
      team compositions as she fills in the roles mentioned before and she does
      not need any investment apart from HP% and HB% on this team composition.

  - title: '**Yelan**'
    description: >-
      A solid unit to have with Cyno. Able to provide a DMG% buff that relies on
      the on-field character’s field time when duration of her Elemental Burst
      is active. Provides consistent Hydro application and paired with Xingqiu
      activates Hydro Resonance, which buffs her Elemental Skill and Elemental
      Burst damage up as they scale with HP%

  - title: '**Xingqiu**'
    description: >-
      Currently provides the fastest Hydro application in the game. Along with
      this, he provides DMG Reduction and healing with his Rainswords and can
      burst out quite a ton of damage with his off-field Elemental Burst DMG.

  - title: '**Bennett**'
    description: >-
      One of the most-contested units in the game due to what they provide to
      team compositions. Flat ATK buff, healing, and decent damage with his
      Elemental Burst, he is usable in every way that needs 1 or 2 of these 3
      roles that he can fill in but with Aggravate being lived, Bennett’s rate
      on pick lowered on Electro DPSs that relies on his said roles so his
      synergy with Cyno is overall decent.

  - title: '**Xiangling**'
    description: >-
      Amazing Pyro unit that provides good off-field damage with her Elemental
      Burst. With it having no ICD, she can proc Overloaded or Overvape with
      team composition that has Cyno or the secondary Electro unit providing
      Electro for these two setups. However, her ER requirements will skyrocket
      without any Pyro battery so be wary of that.

  - title: '**Thoma**'
    description: >-
      Provides a shield and decent Pyro application whenever the on-field units
      triggers a Normal Attack animation. His Elemental Burst provides a
      refreshing shield each time Fiery Collapse is triggered and along with his
      A1 passive that gives him Shield Strength each time the character obtains
      or refreshes the shield and this can stack up to 5 times.

  - title: '**Kazuha**'
    description: >-
      One of the best units in the game due to his unique kit that allows him to
      buff Elemental DMG% depending on what element his Swirl absorbs. With him
      carrying Viridescent Venerer set, he can also provide Elemental Shred to
      said element that is going to receive the Elemental DMG% buff however with
      Cyno, his buff and Viridescent Venerer shred would not last until his
      duration end and will cut out on the middle of his combo.

  - title: '**Sucrose**'
    description: >-
      Secondary Anemo unit to use when Kazuha is unavailable or she excels
      better than him on the team composition that does rely on EM buffs and
      Elemental DMG% when she is C6. This has some drawbacks though as her C6
      requires her to use her Elemental Burst, which is detrimental to her and
      her team rotation as either the rotation extends to be able to fulfill her
      ER requirement or she carries Prototype Amber to lower said ER requirement
      while providing a team wide heal which will lower her EM and her buffing
      potentiality. Suffers the same issue as Kazuha when holding Viridescent
      Venerer set as the RES Shred does not reach Cyno’s full field time.

  - title: '**Jean**'
    description: >-
      Great unit to use when Electro healers are unavailable due to her
      providing heals with Viridescent Venerer but suffers the same consensus
      with Kazuha and Sucrose in terms of the RES Shred. If she is on C2, she
      can drastically change Cyno’s rotation as the ATK SPD will affect his
      timing with his A1 Endseer procs but will yield in more damage as extra
      NA’s are being added.

  - title: '**Sayu**'
    description: >-
      Substitute for Jean if she isn’t available or when no Electro healers are
      available. Her role in this team composition is just to provide heals and
      carry Viridescent Venerer, in accordance with the same consensus with the
      other Anemo units in terms of its RES Shred on Cyno.
