      Cyno’s Elemental Burst is his main source of damage, providing Normal,
      Charged, and Plunging ATK MVs separate from those of his NA MVs. It also
      provides Cyno an additional 100 EM upon entering Pactsworn Pathclearer,
      and converts his NA from Physical to Electro DMG. In corresponding to his
      Elemental Burst, his Elemental Skill should be the same level as it has
      two multipliers: one from outside of Pactsworn Pathclearer and one when he
      is in the Pactsworn Pathclearer state. The CD of the Elemental Skill
      outside of Pactsworn Pathclearer state is longer compared to the one when
      Cyno is in Pactsworn Pathclearer.


      Cyno’s A1 is the most tricky part of his kit, as it forces him to play a
      specific attack combo based on which artifact set he has equipped. This
      passive summons Endseers on the screen, allowing him to buff his Elemental
      Skill by 35% and is considered DMG%, and triggers three Duststalker Bolt
      per Endseer Proc. Its biggest caveat, however, is that it’s hindered by an
      interval that is not linked to anything on his kit, which makes counting
      frames of each of his MVs all the more important to how to maximize
      Endseer procs in his combos while still maintaining the highest MV/s, low
      field time, and TF CD time when running 4PC Thundering Fury set, and
      maintaining the buff timer up until he can cast his Elemental Skill to
      trigger the said buffs. Cyno’s A4 buffs his Elemental Burst NA by 150% and
      his A1 Duskstalker Bolts by 250%, both based on his Elemental Mastery.
      Combined with the Aggravate reaction that also relies on the stat to
      increase its value, this makes Elemental Mastery a very powerful stat for
      Cyno.
