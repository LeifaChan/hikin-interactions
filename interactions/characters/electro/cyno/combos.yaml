      **DISCLAIMER:** *COMBOS WILL BE DETERMINED ON RELEASE IF THEY ARE CORRECT
      OR NOT. TAKE ALL OF THIS COMBO WITH A GRAIN OF SALT WHEN PASSING DOWN THE
      INFORMATION*


      **EQ Mechanic**


      With his Elemental Skill CD outside of Pactsworn Pathclearer being 7.5s,
      casting Elemental Burst after it decrease said CD by 4.5s, allowing Cyno
      to funnel particles while not worrying for his Elemental Skill CD and will
      able to cast a few seconds after entering Pactsworn Pathclearer. 


      __*Combos will be differentiated with Non-TF Combo and TF Combo*__


      __***Non-TF Combo***__


      **EQ N3E N5E N5N2E N5N2E**


      This combo provides the highest MV/s that also gives a decent amount of
      ICD procs that can be used for Aggravates and other reactions. It also
      aligns well with his A1 passive as some of the Endseer procs will either
      pop early than casting the Elemental Skill but all of the A1 buffs are
      triggered nonetheless. 


      **EQ N4E N5E N5N3E N5N3E N3 - C1**


      This combo is only viable if you have Cyno at C1. Adding extra NA’s with
      the same allotted time compared to his C0 non-TF combo provide a greater
      damage comparison to the its C0 combo variant. Although it produces more
      NA’s, the timing of his Elemental Skill CD will not line up on the first
      N5E as you have to wait 0.5-0.7s for the Elemental Skill CD to reset.


      __***TF Combo***__


      **EQ N3E N5E N4E N4E N4E N4E**


      This combo is perfect for such an easy TF Combo that maps out A1 passive
      and TF CD procs. It also provides a good amount of ICD procs that he can
      utilize for reactions. However, the Endseer procs are quite tight to cast
      as 1 of it will pop early depending on the hitlag that Cyno provides on
      your end.


      **EQE N4E N4E N4E N4E N4E N4E N4E - C1**


      This combo is only viable if you have Cyno at C1. Casting the Elemental
      Skill after Elemental Burst leaves a 0.3s waiting time before casting it
      but the time wasted is mitigated by the ATK SPD Buff C1 provides, allowing
      him to get away with casting the Elemental Skill itself + the time waited
      for its CD to be 0s. Combo is pretty straightforward of casting N4E until
      you cast 7 portions of it.
