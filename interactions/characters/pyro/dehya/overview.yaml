- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Dehya is a Pyro Claymore wielder who can play two main roles: an on-field
    DPS alongside Bennett, Kazuha, and Xiangling, or an off-field Burgeon reaction
    DPS, similar to Thoma. \n\nAs an on-field DPS, Dehya’s team compositions are fairly
    strict, and she needs lots of Energy Recharge — at least 200% ER — in order to
    deal adequate damage. She is heavily dependent on buffs from teammates in order
    to deal comparable damage to other Pyro on-field DPSs. Klee is a good comparison,
    though Dehya also has utility in the form of off-field damage mitigation and Pyro
    application. Dehya takes between 8 and 11 seconds on-field. \n\nAs an off-field
    reaction DPS, Dehya ignores her Burst completely and instead focuses purely on
    Elemental Mastery and her Skill in order to deal damage through Burgeon. The Burgeon
    playstyle deals comparable damage to the on-field DPS alternative, assuming you
    can trigger at least eight Burgeon reactions across a maximum of seven instances
    of Pyro application. The benefit of this is that Dehya does not need to level
    her Talents at all, and she spends very little time on-field (~2 seconds). The
    drawback, however, is that she is currently outmatched by Thoma, a 4-star character.\n\nThe
    main reason to use on-field Dehya over off-field Dehya is her scaling with Constellations.
    Off-field Dehya does not benefit nearly as much from them. Regardless of which
    playstyle you choose, you can expect, in ideal team, buff, and gear arrangements
    (according to KQM standards), roughly 13,000 damage-per-second from Dehya. For
    context, an entire team needs to deal at (the very) least 40,000 damage-per-second
    in order to clear Spiral Abyss. This means your other three characters need to
    deal the remaining 60-70% of the required damage, and with such restricted compositions,
    you are limited to supporting teammates that also have exceptional damage output.\n\nUnfortunately,
    there are many restrictions to Dehya’s kit that leave much to be desired. One
    reason that other Elemental Reactions such as Vaporize and Melt are not mentioned
    is because Dehya, during her Burst, cannot trigger Burst waves from characters
    like Xingqiu, Yelan, or Beidou, and she has no single “nuke” attack that can take
    advantage of Melt. This confines her to either Burgeon or no reactions at all
    (Mono-Pyro teams with an Anemo character).\n\nIn Dehya’s current state, there
    are no aspects of her kit that are either unique in effects (Xingqiu and Beidou
    also have DMG Reduction and Interruption Resistance, and shields are often just
    better) or the best in effectiveness (strictly outclassed in Burgeon teams thanks
    to Thoma), with the exception of modest off-field self-healing. In terms of meta,
    it is ill-advised to spend Primogems on Dehya. However, pulling for Dehya because
    you like her design, personality, or some other non-meta conditions is perfectly
    fine."
