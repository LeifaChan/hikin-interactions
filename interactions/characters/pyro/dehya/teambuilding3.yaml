- description: "**Mono Pyro**\nDehya/Bennett/Pyro DPS/Kazuha\n\nIn comparison to her
    other team options, Mono Pyro alleviates much of Dehya’s Energy needs, which makes
    it a comfortable and viable option. That's the good news, now here's the bad.
    Not only are all the members, excluding Dehya, some of the most highly contested
    characters in terms of usage, but also Dehya does considerably less damage and
    requires more ER than Klee, another Mono Pyro DPS. While Klee, thanks to her 4th
    Ascension Passive, decreases the team's Energy requirements, allowing Kazuha,
    Xiangling, and herself to build more into damage rather than ER, Dehya imposes
    her high Energy needs on the rest of the team. Her defensive utility is also rendered
    useless due to Bennett’s healing capabilities, thus slotting her in is a less
    ideal choice than other Pyro characters. \n\n**Kazuha** - Remains the premium
    support for Dehya and other party members due to his DMG% buff, which both Xiangling
    and Dehya like very much. Kazuha also provides CC, which helps with survivability
    and overall DPS due to Dehya’s and Xiangling’s limited ranges \n\n**Bennett**
    - Although he makes some of Dehya’s defensive utility redundant, because Bennett
    provides substantial buffs to both her and Xiangling as well as plentiful Energy
    and healing, he ends up being the best Pyro support for this team. \n\n**Xiangling**
    - A strong consistent source of off-field damage, allowing you to gain more benefits
    from running another unit on-field. One thing to note is that Xiangling will require
    quite a bit of funneling to consistently use her Burst, and this is more so the
    case due to Dehya’s high Energy costs.\n\n**Hu Tao** - A strong on-field carry
    that can make use of Dehya as a Zhongli replacement. Unlike C4 Yanfei or Thoma,
    Dehya’s defensive utility isn't tied to her Burst, so she doesn’t suffer from
    Energy problems. This means Dehya can simply be used as a 4pc ToTM bot in order
    to supply Hutao with buffs and defensive utility.     \n\n**Klee** - Functions
    as an on-field DPS in this team thanks to her rather flexible Elemental Skill.
    Compared to Xiangling, Klee has much more lenient Energy requirements, which is
    something Dehya would prefer. Using Klee also eases the need for Bennett funnels."
