      "description": "For all of the teams listed and more, Dehya can also be used as a general defensive option thanks to the utility she provides, an example of such a team could be VV Hu tao or Melt Ganyu.\n\n**Reverse Melt**\nDehya/Cryo/Bennett/Flex\nCyro options: Kaeya/Rosaria/Ayaka\nFlex options: Anemo/Zhongli \n\nWhen it comes to Melt teams, due to Dehya’s slow Pyro application, she can be used to Melt off fast Cryo applicators or have them Melt off her coordinated attacks. While this is all fine and dandy, Dehya runs into quite a number of issues in this comp. For starters, her multipliers aren't up to par to be worth Melting, as the slot she takes up could be used for an additional Cryo character for more damage and/or buffing as well as Cryo Resonance. Nahida can also be used for additional Pyro application through the use of Burning and a substantial EM buff for your Cryo carry Zhongli is another unit that comes to mind for not only providing better defensive utility than Dehya, but also buffing all party members due to his RES Shred. Even without considering Zhongli as a potential flex unit, Dehya’s defensive utility is already contested by Bennett, since he is already hard slotted into the team by virtue of his ATK buff, healing, and lack of Energy problems.\n\n**Kazuha** - Remains the premium support for buffing Dehya and/or Cryo party members with Double Swirl. One thing to note is that Double Swirling for both Cryo and Pyro is extremely hard to do; this more often than not forces players to pick and choose whether or not you will be buffing your Cryo carry (i.e Rosaria or Dehya) for your rotation. Kazuha also provides CC, which helps with team survivability and positioning due to Dehya’s limited range.  \n\n**Nahida** - Provides high Elemental application both on and off-field, as well as enabling Burnmelt for your Cryo character(s), on top of providing good off-field damage and a massive EM buff for the on-fielder. Both Dehya, if she ever gets to use her Burst, and your Cyro carry can make use of this EM buff, resulting in a greater increase in damage.\n\n**Rosaria** - Deals good damage and provides a teamwide CRIT Rate buff, which alleviates some stat pressure for other carries, as well as being a good Cryo applicator for Dehya to Melt consistently. \n\n**Ayaka** - Together with Kaeya or Rosaria and Bennett, offers Dehya a chance at performing as an on-field Melt carry. Rosaria and Bennett are both essential for batterying their respective DPS, and with Bennett's buffs, Rosaria's CRIT Rate, Pyro and Cryo Resonance, Dehya can unleash her flurry of flaming punches straight through Ayaka's Blizzard and Rosaria's Burst ticks. One thing to note is that Ayaka is going to be your primary source of damage. With that in mind, Ayaka's ER should be accommodated in order to not have severe issues in DPR downtime when playing this comp.\n\n**Bennett** - Although he invalidates Dehya’s defensive utility, Bennett remains a must-have with Dehya in teams where she bursts in, because not only does Dehya have significant her Energy issues without him, but also Bennett buffs her damage output considerably — to the point where Dehya suffers tremendous losses without him.",

      "description": "**Regarding Ganyu and Dehya **\nDehya/Bennett/Ganyu/Flex \nFlex: Zhongli/Nahida/Sucrose/Kazuha\n\nThere is another team that Dehya surprisingly fits well in — Ganyu Melt — due to Dehya’s ability to increase other characters’ Interruption Resistance within her Skill. Units like Ganyu, who are particularly vulnerable to interruption, benefit greatly from this skill. It is important to note that Dehya also runs into a severe issue involving set ups with Ganyu, as Dehya’s Elemental Skill tick doesn't line up well with Ganyu’s Charged Attack charging time. This results in a scenario where Ganyu’s first CA will be Melted, but additional CA’s will end up as cannon fodder for Dehya’s Skill. Adding another Pyro applicator could fix this issue, but that could end up creating more issues with team-building. \n\nAdditionally, the slot that Dehya takes up could typically be given to another character with more overall benefit, such as Nahida and her EM buffing, or Kazuha as a 4VV holder and Elemental DMG% buffer.  \n\n**Sucrose** is another alternative to the aforementioned characters, providing both 4VV and EM sharing, but she runs into problems of her own, such as her Burst’s high Energy Cost. \n\nYet another alternative is **Zhongli**, who not only has very strong defensive utility, but also can run buffer sets like 4TotM. However, in choosing to run him, Dehya’s main purpose in the team becomes redundant, with the only loss being less Pyro application. For many players after Version 3.5, Dehya may become a more accessible option than Zhongli with her addition to the standard banner. \n\nUltimately, she provides another unique option to slot in Ganyu Melt teams, but the issues that arise from using her substantially decrease her overall value to the comp.",
