The difference between these sets in both of their ideal conditions is less than 1%. Because of this, it’s best to just go with the best substats. \n\nFor 4pc Gilded Dreams, Dehya should be the only Pyro member of the team, though luckily, you want her as the only Pyro character *anyways,* so this is not a drawback.\n\n4pc Paradise Lost is agnostic regarding team composition, but because you want Dehya to be the only Pyro character on the team anyways in Burgeon teams, the agnosticism is not a benefit. \n\nIn sum, both deal about the same damage. Just pick whatever’s easiest to farm. This will likely be 4pc Gilded Dreams, as 4pc Deepwood Memories is an important artifact set to farm for other characters.",
