      Her selection of weapons can be separated into two focuses: shield support
      or  off-field DPS. And the ranking would vary since for shield support she
      would like as much HP as possible, while for off-field DPS, Crit would
      matter a lot more. The DMG gain from extra ATK is negligible, therefore
      weapons with ATK substat is not recommended. 


      **The DMG gained/Shield Absorption lost or vice versa when switching build
      direction is not significant compared to other characters. Please
      reference Layla Mastersheet for detailed comparison. **


      For **Shield Support** builds, the difference between high-investment and
      low-investment shields is miniscule, meaning you can be liberal in weapon
      choice for this build. In that case, weapons with overall team support
      capabilities start to become more preferable, such as **Key of
      Khaj-Nisut,  Freedom Sworn** and **Favonius Sword. **


      For **Off-field DPS** builds, the standout performer here is **Harbinger
      of Dawn.** Being a 3 star weapon the low base ATK is less of an issue for
      Layla, and it provides plenty of Crit stats which she really benefits
      from. Her off-field nature also means she can take advantage of the
      passive very well, since there are few opportunities for Layla to take
      damage. **Primordial Jade Cutter** is also a strong option for her. For
      the rest of the options, weapons with ER% or Crit substats are preferable,
      and higher substat value is preferred over higher base ATK.
