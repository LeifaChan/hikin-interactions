      **General Shielder**


      Layla can be a shielder in various comps with on-field characters that
      want the Interrupt Resistance (Melt Ganyu, Yoimiya, Cyno). On-field units
      that perform more skill casts can get more value out of Layla, as Layla
      gains 2 Shooting Star stacks every time your on-field character casts an
      Elemental Skill. Do note that in some teams, Layla’s Cryo application
      might interfere with Elemental application, such as in Melt Ganyu. This
      can be mitigated by not casting your Burst.

      -Layla/Cryo/Hydro/Anemo


      Layla can be a more offensive alternative for Diona in Freeze teams where
      you want Diona’s battery capabilities and shielding. Layla provides
      defensive utility, Cryo energy generation, and the ability to hold support
      sets like 4ToTM, which is more valuable in teams that use 4BS. Freeze
      teams also help preserve Layla’s shield by making enemies unable to attack
      to break it, which allows you to get more Shooting Star triggers.


      The main Cryo DPS in this team will generally be Ayaka or Ganyu, although
      you can run a unit like Rosaria or Kaeya as a budget alternative that can
      get more value out of Layla by playing in a quickswap combat style,
      getting more skill casts for Layla’s Shooting Stars.

  - title: '**Mono-Cryo**'
    description: >-
      -Layla/Cryo/Cryo/Anemo


      An alternative to freeze teams for enemies that cannot be frozen.
      Mono-Cryo teams work by stacking more Cryo units to synergize with each
      other by generating more Cryo particles, benefitting from the first half
      of the 4-piece Blizzard Strayer set bonus, and gaining more value out of
      Shenhe’s *Icy Quills*, which incentivizes you to run as many Cryo units as
      you can. Layla works well with Shenhe as she can use up the Icy Quill
      stacks quickly due to her multi-hit nature.


      Though not recommended, players without Shenhe can opt to run Rosaria
      and/or Kaeya instead as a budget alternative, which synergizes well with
      Layla due to their low cooldown Elemental Skills.

  - title: '**Forward Melt**'
    description: >-
      -Bennett/Layla/Anemo/Cryo, Anemo or Hydro


      Layla’s Shooting Star mechanic rewards you for spamming Elemental Skills,
      and applies Cryo for Bennett to Melt his Elemental Skill. Using Bennett’s
      low-cooldown E allows Layla to get more Shooting Star stacks than normal,
      which improves Layla’s energy generation and personal damage. 


      An Anemo grouping unit is preferred for the third slot to provide VV and
      other team buffs and utility, while the last unit can be any off-field
      unit that will not interfere with the Cryo application needed for forward
      Melts, but a second Cryo unit is recommended for the increased Cryo
      application.

  - title: '**Eula**'
    description: >-
      -Eula/Layla/Electro/Flex


      Layla can be a defensive option in Eula teams, and still give offensive
      utility through her good uptime on 4TotM and a bit of personal damage. Due
      to Eula’s energy consumption timing, Layla can be a better battery for
      Eula because she generates her energy over time, instead of Diona’s
      upfront energy generation. The two last slots in the team are very
      flexible, though it is generally recommended to bring an Electro unit to
      trigger Superconduct for the Physical Resistance Shred.

  - title: '**Laylational**'
    description: >-
      -Layla/Bennett/Xingqiu/Xiangling


      Layla can be added as the flex slot in the National core to hold support
      sets like 4ToTM or 4Instructor and let Xiangling melt instead of vaping
      some of her Pyronado hits.

  - title: '**Fridge**'
    description: >-
      Fridge teams are teams that use the interaction between Dendro and Cryo
      where both of them can co-exist on a target so applying Hydro onto the
      enemy will reduce the amount of Dendro consumed when triggering Bloom
      reactions while also keeping them frozen. These teams focus on increasing
      the amount of Blooms that you can trigger, which gives you more seeds that
      you can further react with by adding a Pyro or Electro character, or just
      using Bloom by itself, since Bloom will automatically explode when there
      are more than five on the field.


      Layla is not recommended for some Fridge teams as Bloom damage will break
      her shield and stop her Cryo application, rendering her ineffective.
      However, this can be mitigated by using an Electro character to trigger
      Hyperbloom with the seeds, as Hyperbloomed seeds are less likely to damage
      your shield.
