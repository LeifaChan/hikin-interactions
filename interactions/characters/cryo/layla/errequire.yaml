  - title: __**ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENT**__
    description: >-
      One thing to keep in mind is her Burst uptime. Having 100% uptime means
      she can either use it once in a 23 seconds or lower rotation, or up to
      twice in some 25 seconds rotations. It is tough to keep up with Bursting
      off cooldown in non-Cryo teams, since not catching any Cryo particles
      generated and investing that energy to other characters is more
      advantageous. With her Constellation 2 active, her ER requirement drops
      significantly, and so  Bursting every 12 seconds becomes viable.
